abstract = {In animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) of 21–35 nucleotides in length silence transposable elements, regulate gene expression and fight viral infection. piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to cleave target RNA, promote heterochromatin assembly and methylate DNA. The architecture of the piRNA pathway allows it both to provide adaptive, sequence-based immunity to rapidly evolving viruses and transposons and to regulate conserved host genes. piRNAs silence transposons in the germ line of most animals, whereas somatic piRNA functions have been lost, gained and lost again across evolution. Moreover, most piRNA pathway proteins are deeply conserved, but different animals employ remarkably divergent strategies to produce piRNA precursor transcripts. Here, we discuss how a common piRNA pathway allows animals to recognize diverse targets, ranging from selfish genetic elements to genes essential for gametogenesis.},

abstract = {Introduction: Deregulation of Polycomb member Bmi-1 is involved in cell proliferation and human oncogenesis. Modulation of Bmi-1 is found in several tumor tissues, including primary breast carcinomas; however, analysis of Bmi-1 in plasma of cancer patients has not been reported. This is the first study that evaluates Bmi-1 in plasma by using a large series of primary breast carcinomas to investigate the presence at diagnosis of detectable Bmi-1 mRNA in plasma and possible correlations between this event and a series of clinical-pathological parameters of the tumors. Methods: Bmi-1 expression levels were quantified in plasma of 111 breast cancer patients and in 20 healthy controls by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Cancer patients with the presence of Bmi-1 mRNA in plasma had higher levels of Bmi-1 expression than healthy controls with Bmi-1 mRNA in plasma. The higher expression levels of Bmi-1 correlated with well-established markers of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer such as positive p53 immunostaining and negative progesterone receptors. Moreover, we described for the first time a statistically significant correlation between Bmi-1 expression in plasma of breast cancer patients and disease-free and overall survival in advanced stages. Conclusion: Our results suggest that levels of Bmi-1 expression may be a surrogate marker of poor prognosis and may become clinically useful as noninvasive diagnostic markers. {\textcopyright} 2007 Silva et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The European Association of Urology (EAU) prognostic factor risk groups for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are used to provide recommendations for patient treatment after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). They do not, however, take into account the widely used World Health Organization (WHO) 2004/2016 grading classification and are based on patients treated in the 1980s. Objective: To update EAU prognostic factor risk groups using the WHO 1973 and 2004/2016 grading classifications and identify patients with the lowest and highest probabilities of progression. Design, setting, and participants: Individual patient data for primary NMIBC patients were collected from the institutions of the members of the EAU NMIBC guidelines panel. Intervention: Patients underwent TURBT followed by intravesical instillations at the physician's discretion. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models were fitted to the primary endpoint, the time to progression to muscle-invasive disease or distant metastases. Patients were divided into four risk groups: low-, intermediate-, high-, and a new, very high-risk group. The probabilities of progression were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results and limitations: A total of 3401 patients treated with TURBT ± intravesical chemotherapy were included. From the multivariable analyses, tumor stage, WHO 1973/2004–2016 grade, concomitant carcinoma in situ, number of tumors, tumor size, and age were used to form four risk groups for which the probability of progression at 5 yr varied from {\textless}1{\%} to {\textgreater}40{\%}. Limitations include the retrospective collection of data and the lack of central pathology review. Conclusions: This study provides updated EAU prognostic factor risk groups that can be used to inform patient treatment and follow-up. Incorporating the WHO 2004/2016 and 1973 grading classifications, a new, very high-risk group has been identified for which urologists should be prompt to assess and adapt their therapeutic strategy when necessary. Patient summary: The newly updated European Association of Urology prognostic factor risk groups for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer provide an improved basis for recommending a patient's treatment and follow-up schedule.},

abstract = {For most Americans, staying "mentally sharp" as they age is a very high priority. Declines in memory and decision-making abilities may trigger fears of Alzheimer{\&}{\#}039;s disease or other neurodegenerative diseases. However, cognitive aging is a natural process that can have both positive and negative effects on cognitive function in older adults - effects that vary widely among individuals. At this point in time, when the older population is rapidly growing in the United States and across the globe, it is important to examine what is known about cognitive aging and to identify and promote actions that individuals, organizations, communities, and society can take to help older adults maintain and improve their cognitive health. Cognitive Aging assesses the public health dimensions of cognitive aging with an emphasis on definitions and terminology, epidemiology and surveillance, prevention and intervention, education of health professionals, and public awareness and education. This report makes specific recommendations for individuals to reduce the risks of cognitive decline with aging. Aging is inevitable, but there are actions that can be taken by individuals, families, communities, and society that may help to prevent or ameliorate the impact of aging on the brain, understand more about its impact, and help older adults live more fully and independent lives. Cognitive aging is not just an individual or a family or a health care system challenge. It is an issue that affects the fabric of society and requires actions by many and varied stakeholders. Cognitive Aging offers clear steps that individuals, families, communities, health care providers and systems, financial organizations, community groups, public health agencies, and others can take to promote cognitive health and to help older adults live fuller and more independent lives. Ultimately, this report calls for a societal commitment to cognitive aging as a public health issue that requires prompt action across many sectors.},

KRAS wild-type tumors harbored alterations in other oncogenic drivers, including GNAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, and additional RAS pathway genes. A subset of tumors harbored multiple KRAS mutations, with some showing evidence of biallelic mutations. Protein profiling identified a favorable prognosis subset with low epithelial-mesenchymal transition and high MTOR pathway scores. Associations of non-coding RNAs with tumor-specific mRNA subtypes were also identified.

On the other hand, recent developments of nucleic acid sequence analysis allows to use minimally invasive serial blood samples to assess the mutational status and altered gene expression patterns for real time monitoring in individual patients.

MAPKs regulate cell proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways are a cascade of signaling enzymes starting with the transmission of a signal from a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) located on the cell surface to the nucleus and ending in the regulation of transcription of target genes. Due to its importance in human cancers, MAPK/ERK signaling pathways are attractive targets for cancer drug development. In this chapter, we will present the MAPK signaling pathway and outline the function of the most relevant protein mediators that facilitate signaling. We will also highlight negative regulators of the pathway, drugs designed to block signaling, and ongoing clinical trials.},

The ability to probe a sample for hundred to million different molecules at once has made DNA microarray one of the fastest growing techniques since its introduction about 15 years ago. Microarray technology can be used for large scale genotyping, gene expression profiling, comparative genomic hybridization and resequencing among other applications. Microarray technology is a complex mixture of numerous technology and research fields such as mechanics, microfabrication, chemistry, DNA behaviour, microfluidics, enzymology, optics and bioinformatics. This chapter will give an introduction to each five basic steps in microarray technology that includes fabrication, target preparation, hybridization, detection and data analysis. Basic concepts and nomenclature used in the field of microarray technology and their relationships will also be explained.},

abstract = {The JAK-STAT pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and embryological processes. Aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway due to genetic mutations, amplifications, or polymorphisms can lead to constitutive or persistent activation of the pathway and affect the development of some cancers. In this review, we discuss the major signaling molecules involved in the JAK-STAT pathway and their role in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In addition, we discuss FDA-approved drugs and other JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors that are in clinical trials or under preclinical development. Despite recent developments in our understanding of the JAK-STAT pathway, it remains to be determined precisely how the JAK-STAT pathway drives tumor development and oncogenic phenotypes. Due to the complex cross talk of the JAK-STAT pathway with other signaling pathways, further studies exploring the direct role and contribution of the JAK-STAT pathway toward tumor initiation and development are needed. These studies should illuminate whether treatment with JAK inhibitors alone or in combination with inhibitors that target complimentary signaling pathways can be therapeutic in cancer patients and which patients are most likely to benefit.},

@article{Gupta2006,
abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Although many individuals with pancreatic cancer have diabetes, the association between new-onset diabetes mellitus and the subsequent incidence of pancreatic cancer is unclear. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate the incidence of pancreatic cancer subsequent to a new diabetes diagnosis and to evaluate factors associated with a subsequent pancreatic cancer diagnosis. We used the Veterans Health Administration National Patient Care Database to assemble a cohort of 1,421,794 US veterans without prior diabetes or pancreatic cancer diagnoses. We recorded coding for new diabetes diagnoses (≥2 International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for diabetes within a 12-month period), pancreatic cancer, age, sex, race, and common gastrointestinal symptoms. Results A total of 36,631 (2.6{\%}) of the 1,421,794 veterans were diagnosed with new-onset diabetes in 1999; 149 subsequently received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer incidence in patients with new-onset diabetes (83.8/100,000 person-years) was 2.2-fold higher (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.84-2.56) than in nondiabetics, and was highest during the first 2 years after diabetes diagnosis. One additional pancreatic cancer was diagnosed for every 332 new diabetics over 6 years. A subsequent pancreatic cancer diagnosis (among new-onset diabetics) was associated independently with younger age groups, changes in bowel habits, constipation, epigastric pain, and malnutrition. Conclusions New-onset diabetes was associated with a significantly increased rate of pancreatic cancer diagnosis, particularly in the first 2 years after diabetes diagnosis. Factors associated with pancreatic cancer diagnosis included younger age groups and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. The absolute incidence of pancreatic cancer was low.},

abstract = {When patients randomised to the control group of a randomised controlled trial are allowed to switch onto the experimental treatment, intention-to-treat analyses of the treatment effect are confounded because the separation of randomised groups is lost. Previous research has investigated statistical methods that aim to estimate the treatment effect that would have been observed had this treatment switching not occurred and has demonstrated their performance in a limited set of scenarios. Here, we investigate these methods in a new range of realistic scenarios, allowing conclusions to be made based upon a broader evidence base. We simulated randomised controlled trials incorporating prognosis-related treatment switching and investigated the impact of sample size, reduced switching proportions, disease severity, and alternative data-generating models on the performance of adjustment methods, assessed through a comparison of bias, mean squared error, and coverage, related to the estimation of true restricted mean survival in the absence of switching in the control group. Rank preserving structural failure time models, inverse probability of censoring weights, and two-stage methods consistently produced less bias than the intention-to-treat analysis. The switching proportion was confirmed to be a key determinant of bias: sample size and censoring proportion were relatively less important. It is critical to determine the size of the treatment effect in terms of an acceleration factor (rather than a hazard ratio) to provide information on the likely bias associated with rank-preserving structural failure time model adjustments. In general, inverse probability of censoring weight methods are more volatile than other adjustment methods.},

abstract = {Selection bias due to loss to follow up represents a threat to the internal validity of estimates derived from cohort studies. Over the past 15 years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-to-event framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute measure (e.g., absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, real-world data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted techniques.},

abstract = {Purpose: To provide recommendations on appropriate clinical trial designs in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) based on current literature and expert consensus of the International Bladder Cancer Group. Methods: We reviewed published trials, guidelines, meta-analyses, and reviews and provided recommendations on eligibility criteria, baseline evaluations, end points, study designs, comparators, clinically meaningful magnitude of effect, and sample size. Results: NMIBC trials must be designed to provide the most clinically relevant data for the specific risk category of interest (low, intermediate, or high). Specific eligibility criteria and baseline evaluations depend on the risk category being studied. For the population of patients for whom bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) has failed, the type of failure (BCG unresponsive, refractory, relapsing, or intolerant) should be clearly defined to make comparisons across trials feasible. Single-arm designs may be relevant for the BCG-unresponsive population. Here, a clinically meaningful initial complete response rate (for carcinoma in situ) or recurrence-free rate (for papillary tumors) of at least 50{\%} at 6 months, 30{\%} at 12 months, and 25{\%} at 18 months is recommended. For other risk levels, randomized superiority trial designs are recommended; noninferiority trials are to be used sparingly given the large sample size required. Placebo control is considered unethical for all intermediate- and high-risk strata; therefore, control arms should comprise the current guideline-recommended standard of care for the respective risk level. In general, trials should use time to recurrence or recurrence-free survival as the primary end point and time to progression, toxicity, disease-specific survival, and overall survival as potential secondary end points. Realistic efficacy thresholds should be set to ensure that novel therapies receive due review by regulatory bodies. Conclusion: The International Bladder Cancer Group has developed formal recommendations regarding definitions, end points, and clinical trial designs for NMIBC to encourage uniformity among studies in this disease.},

abstract = {Background The ESPAC-3 trial showed that adjuvant gemcitabine is the standard of care based on similar survival to and less toxicity than adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. Other clinical trials have shown better survival and tumour response with gemcitabine and capecitabine than with gemcitabine alone in advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine and capecitabine compared with gemcitabine monotherapy for resected pancreatic cancer. Methods We did a phase 3, two-group, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical trial at 92 hospitals in England, Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, and Sweden. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had undergone complete macroscopic resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (R0 or R1 resection). We randomly assigned patients (1:1) within 12 weeks of surgery to receive six cycles of either 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine alone administered once a week for three of every 4 weeks (one cycle) or with 1660 mg/m2 oral capecitabine administered for 21 days followed by 7 days' rest (one cycle). Randomisation was based on a minimisation routine, and country was used as a stratification factor. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, and assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Toxicity was analysed in all patients who received trial treatment. This trial was registered with the EudraCT, number 2007-004299-38, and ISRCTN, number ISRCTN96397434. Findings Of 732 patients enrolled, 730 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 366 were randomly assigned to receive gemcitabine and 364 to gemcitabine plus capecitabine. The Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee requested reporting of the results after there were 458 (95{\%}) of a target of 480 deaths. The median overall survival for patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group was 28{\textperiodcentered}0 months (95{\%} CI 23{\textperiodcentered}5–31{\textperiodcentered}5) compared with 25{\textperiodcentered}5 months (22{\textperiodcentered}7–27{\textperiodcentered}9) in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}82 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}68–0{\textperiodcentered}98], p=0{\textperiodcentered}032). 608 grade 3–4 adverse events were reported by 226 of 359 patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group compared with 481 grade 3–4 adverse events in 196 of 366 patients in the gemcitabine group. Interpretation The adjuvant combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine should be the new standard of care following resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Funding Cancer Research UK.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation make up a small subgroup of those with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has had antitumor activity in this population. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients who had a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer and disease that had not progressed during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 3:2 ratio, to receive maintenance olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review. RESULTS Of the 3315 patients who underwent screening, 154 underwent randomization and were assigned to a trial intervention (92 to receive olaparib and 62 to receive placebo). The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (7.4 months vs. 3.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.53; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.82; P = 0.004). An interim analysis of overall survival, at a data maturity of 46{\%}, showed no difference between the olaparib and placebo groups (median, 18.9 months vs. 18.1 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.91; 95{\%} CI, 0.56 to 1.46; P = 0.68). There was no significant between-group difference in health-related quality of life, as indicated by the overall change from baseline in the global quality-of-life score (on a 100-point scale, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (between-group difference, -2.47 points; 95{\%} CI, -7.27 to 2.33). The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 40{\%} in the olaparib group and 23{\%} in the placebo group (between-group difference, 16 percentage points; 95{\%} CI, -0.02 to 31); 5{\%} and 2{\%} of the patients, respectively, discontinued the trial intervention because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with a germline BRCA mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer, progression-free survival was longer with maintenance olaparib than with placebo.

abstract = {incidence and epidemiology A recent study estimating cancer epidemiology in 2014 (within Europe) showed that pancreatic cancer was the fourth most fatal cancer in men after lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers [1]. Similarly, pancreatic cancer was found to be the fourth most fatal cancer in women after breast, colorectal and lung cancers [1]. With a life expectancy of ∼5{\%} at 5 years, the prognosis of this cancer has not improved over the past 20 years, and incidence and mortality rates are very similar. Death due to pancreatic car-cinoma is increasing in Europe with the number rising from 75 439 in 2009 to a projected 82 300 deaths in 2014 (+19{\%}) [1]. It usually arises in elderly patients with a mean age at onset of 71 years for men and 75 years for women. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer progress to either metastatic or locally advanced disease in the asymptomatic phase. Surgical excision is the definitive treatment with a 5-year survival rate (after resec-tion) of ∼20{\%}, but it is only possible in 15{\%}-20{\%} of the patients. The opportunity to detect pancreatic cancer, while it remains curable, depends on the ability to identify and screen high-risk populations before their symptoms arise. Defining the treatment strategy for patients suffering from pancreatic carcinoma requires a specialised multidisciplinary team that includes: surgeons, medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiation therapists, radi-ologists, and supportive and palliative care specialists. The vast majority ({\textgreater}80{\%}) of pancreatic carcinomas are due to sporadically occurring mutations. Only a small proportion ({\textless}10{\%}) are due to inherited germline mutations. Germline mutations in BRCA2, p16, ATM, STK11, PRSS1/PRSS2, SPINK1, PALB2, and DNA mismatch repair genes are associated with varying degrees of increased risk for pancreatic carcinoma [2]. Familial pancreatic cancers, defined as at least two first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, account for only 5{\%}-10{\%} of all pancreatic cancer cases. Mutation in BRCA2 is probably the most common inherited disorder in familial pancreatic cancer. Other familial syndromes linked to pancreatic cancer are: hereditary pancreatitis, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The main acquired risk factors for pancreatic cancer are cigarette smoking (overall relative risk 1.74) and, to a lesser degree, environmental tobacco smoke. The second most modifiable risk factor of pancreatic cancer is obesity. Tumorigenesis is enhanced by excess adipose tissue, probably through the mechanism of abnormal glucose metabolism. Obesity [body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater} 30 kb/m 2 ] is associated with a 20{\%}-40{\%} higher rate of death from pancreatic cancer. Meta-analyses have demonstrated associations between both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer, with odds ratios of ∼2.0 and 1.8, respectively [2]. Chronic pancreatitis accounts for ∼5{\%} of pancreatic cancers. The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, in Europe, is excess alcohol consumption. The causal pathway is not clear, however, alcohol consumption by itself is related to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, and human immunodefi-ciency virus infection have also been reported to be related to an increase in relative risk of pancreatic cancer, although some confounding factors such as cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption have not always been considered [2]. Dietary factors have been studied extensively, and clearly contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer. Independent of their role in causing obesity: butter, saturated fat, red meat, and processed foods are clearly linked to pancreatic cancer [3]. Conversely, a high fruit and folate intake could reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer [3]. Different chemical substances have been reported to increase the relative risk of developing pancreatic cancer, among these †},

abstract = {Background: To evaluate the impact of radiation dose on overall survival (OS) in patients treated with adjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: A multicenter retrospective analysis on 514 patients with PDAC (T1-4; N0-1; M0) treated with surgical resection with macroscopically negative margins (R0-1) followed by adjuvant CRT was performed. Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on radiotherapy doses (group 1: {\textless} 45 Gy, group 2: ≥ 45 and {\textless} 50 Gy, group 3: ≥ 50 and {\textless} 55 Gy, group 4: ≥ 55 Gy). Adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed to 141 patients. Survival functions were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared through the log-rank test. Results: Median follow-up was 35 months (range: 3-120 months). At univariate analysis, a worse OS was recorded in patients with higher preoperative Ca 19.9 levels (≥ 90 U/ml; p {\textless} 0.001), higher tumor grade (G3-4, p = 0.004), R1 resection (p = 0.004), higher pT stage (pT3-4, p = 0.002) and positive nodes (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, patients receiving increasing doses of CRT showed a significantly improved OS. In groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, median OS was 13.0 months, 21.0 months, 22.0 months, and 28.0 months, respectively (p = 0.004). The significant impact of higher dose was confirmed by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Increasing doses of CRT seems to favorably impact on OS in adjuvant setting. The conflicting results of randomized trials on adjuvant CRT in PDAC could be due to {\textless} 45 Gy dose generally used.},

abstract = {PURPOSE AZD1775 (adavosertib) is an inhibitor of the Wee1 kinase. In this study, we built on our preclinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine and radiation in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty-four patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer were enrolled with the intention to receive four 21-day cycles of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8) with AZD1775 (once daily on days 1, 2, 8, and 9). Cycles 2 and 3 were administered concurrently with radiation, and cycles 5 to 8 were optional. AZD1775 was dose escalated using a time-to-event continual reassessment method on the basis of the rate of dose-limiting toxicities within the first 15 weeks of therapy. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD1775 given in conjunction with gemcitabine and radiation. Secondary objectives were to estimate overall and progression-free survival and determine pharmacodynamic activity of AZD1775 in surrogate tissues. RESULTS The recommended phase II dose of AZD1775 was 150 mg/d. Eight patients (24{\%}) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, most commonly anorexia, nausea, or fatigue. The median overall survival for all patients was 21.7 months (90{\%} CI, 16.7 to 24.8 months), and the median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (90{\%} CI, 8.0 to 9.9 months). Hair follicle biopsy samples demonstrated evidence of Wee1 inhibition with decreased phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 staining by immunohistochemistry after AZD1775 administration at the recommended phase II dose. CONCLUSION AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine and radiation therapy was well tolerated at a dose that produced target engagement in a surrogate tissue. The overall survival is substantially higher than prior results combining gemcitabine with radiation therapy and warrants additional investigation.},

abstract = {Importance In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the role of chemoradiotherapy is controversial and the efficacy of erlotinib is unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess whether chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and to assess the effect of erlotinib on survival. DESIGN, SETTING,ANDPARTICIPANTS InLAP07, an international, open-label, phase3randomized trial, 449 patientswere enrolled between 2008and 2011. Follow-up ended in February 2013. INTERVENTIONS In the first randomization, 223 patients received 1000mg/m2 weekly of gemcitabine alone and 219 patients received 1000mg/m2 of gemcitabine plus 100mg/d of erlotinib. In the second randomization involving patients with progression-free disease after 4 months, 136 patients received 2 months of the same chemotherapy and 133 underwent chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy plus capecitabine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas overall survival from the date of the first randomization. Secondary outcomeswere the effect of erlotinib and quality assurance of radiotherapy on overall survival, progression-free survival of gemcitabine-erlotinib and erlotinib maintenance with gemcitabine alone at the second randomization, and toxic effects. RESULTS A total of 442 of the 449 patients (232 men; median age, 63.3 years) enrolled underwent the first randomization. Of these, 269 underwent the second randomization. Interim analysis was performed when 221 patients died (109 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 112 in the chemotherapy group), reaching the early stopping boundaries for futility. With a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall survival from the date of the first randomization was not significantly different between chemotherapy at 16.5 months (95{\%}CI, 14.5-18.5 months) and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months (95{\%}CI, 13.9-17.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95{\%}CI, 0.79-1.34; P =.83). Median overall survival from the date of the first randomization for the 223 patients receiving gemcitabine was 13.6 months (95{\%}CI, 12.3-15.3 months) and was 11.9 months (95{\%}CI, 10.4-13.5 months) for the 219 patients receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib (HR, 1.19; 95{\%}CI, 0.97-1.45; P =.09; 188 deaths vs 191 deaths). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with decreased local progression (32{\%}vs 46{\%}, P =.03) and no increase in grade 3 to 4 toxicity, except for nausea. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this open-label, randomized trial involving patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone and there was no significant difference in overall survival with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Preoperative chemoradiotherapy may improve the radical resection rate for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, but the overall benefit is unproven. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized phase III trial in 16 centers, patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, which consisted of 3 courses of gemcitabine, the second combined with 15 3 2.4 Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery and 4 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine or to immediate surgery and 6 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine. The primary end point was overall survival by intention to treat. RESULTS Between April 2013 and July 2017, 246 eligible patients were randomly assigned; 119 were assigned to preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 127 to immediate surgery. Median overall survival by intention to treat was 16.0 months with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 14.3 months with immediate surgery (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95{\%} CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P = .096). The resection rate was 61{\%} and 72{\%} (P = .058). The R0 resection rate was 71{\%} (51 of 72) in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 40{\%} (37 of 92) in patients assigned to immediate surgery (P, .001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly better disease-free survival and locoregional failure-free interval as well as with significantly lower rates of pathologic lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and venous invasion. Survival analysis of patients who underwent tumor resection and started adjuvant chemotherapy showed improved survival with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (35.2 v 19.8 months; P = .029). The proportion of patients who suffered serious adverse events was 52{\%} versus 41{\%} (P = .096). CONCLUSION Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer did not show a significant overall survival benefit. Although the outcomes of the secondary end points and predefined subgroup analyses suggest an advantage of the neoadjuvant approach, additional evidence is required.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers. Curative-intended resection and adjuvant chemotherapy represents the current standard of care. Despite substantial improvements in surgical treatment and intensified adjuvant treatment with more powerful regimens over the last years even clearly resectable pancreatic cancer still has an unfavorable prognosis with a high risk of relapse. Neoadjuvant or perioperative multimodal therapies have substantially improved the outcome of other resectable gastrointestinal (GI) cancers such as esophagus and gastric cancer. It is reasonable to assume that efficient chemotherapy and or radiochemotherapy may have a similar impact on the outcome of resectable PDAC. This review is focused on neoadjuvant and perioperative treatment of resectable PDAC (no borderline resectable or locally advanced PDAC), summarizes the pros and cons for neoadjuvant treatment in the context of the current literature, and also provides an overview over the landscape of ongoing clinical trials in this up-and-coming field of PDAC therapy.},

abstract = {Due to differences in natural history and therapy, clinical trials of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have recently been subdivided into unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and metastatic disease. We aimed to evaluate prognostic factors in LAPC patients who were treated with first-line chemotherapy and describe patterns of disease progression. Patients with LAPC who initiated first-line palliative chemotherapy, 2001-2011 at the BC Cancer Agency were included. A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify clinicopathologic variables, treatment, and subsequent sites of metastasis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression survival analyses were performed. A total of 244 patients were included in this study. For the majority of patients (94.3{\%}), first-line therapy was single-agent gemcitabine. About 144 (59{\%}) patients developed distant metastatic disease and the most frequent metastatic sites included peritoneum/omentum (42.3{\%}), liver (41{\%}), lungs (13.9{\%}), and distant lymph nodes (9{\%}). Median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 11.7 months (95{\%} CI, 10.6-12.8). Development of distant metastases was associated with significantly inferior survival (HR 3.56, 95{\%} CI 2.57-4.93), as was ECOG 2/3 versus 0/1 (HR 1.69, 95{\%} CI 1.28-2.23), CA 19.9 {\textgreater} 1000 versus ≤1000 (HR 1.59, 95{\%} CI 1.19-2.14) and female gender, (HR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.19-2.08). In this population-based study, 41{\%} of LAPC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy died without evidence of distant metastases. Prognostic factors for LAPC were baseline performance status, elevated CA 19.9, gender, and development of distant metastasis. Results highlight the heterogeneity of LAPC and the importance of locoregional tumor control. Recently, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have been subdivided into two groups: those with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and metastatic disease. This study identifies prognostic factors and the patterns of progression of LAPC which may influence the way that this disease is treated. This study demonstrates the heterogeneity of patients in this population and emphasizes the importance of locoregional tumor control.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, and has a poor, five-year survival rate of 5{\%}. Although complete surgical resection is the only curative therapy for pancreatic cancer, less than 20{\%} of newly-diagnosed patients undergo surgical resection with a curative intent. Due to the lack of early symptoms and the tendency of pancreatic adenocarci-noma to invade adjacent structures or to metastasize at an early stage, many patients with pancreatic cancer already have advanced disease at the time of their diagnosis and, therefore, there is a high mortality rate. To improve the patient survival rate, early detection of PC is critical. The diagnosis of PC relies on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatog-raphy (MRCP), or biopsy or fne-needle aspiration using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Although multi-detector row computed tomography currently has a major role in the evaluation of PC, MRI with MRCP facilitates better detection of tumors at an early stage by allowing a comprehensive analysis of the morphological changes of the pancreas parenchyma and pancreatic duct. The diagnosis could be improved using positron emission tomography techniques in special conditions in which CT and EUS are not completely diagnostic. It is essential for clinicians to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the various pancreatic imaging modalities in order to be able to make optimal treatment and management decisions. Our study investigates the current role and innovative techniques of pancreatic imaging focused on the detection of pancreatic cancer. {\textcopyright} 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The aims of this study are to evaluate the antitumor and therapeutic effects of vitamin D status for pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: A literature search for relevant studies was conducted using PubMed and Embase databases. Risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR), and 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) were used as the effect measures. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software 12.0. Results: Our results indicated that high plasma 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with pancreatic cancer mortality without significant heterogeneity (HR=0.81, 95{\%} CI=0.68-0.96). However, high plasma 25(OH)D levels could not reduce pancreatic cancer risk (RR=1.02, 95{\%} CI=0.66-1.57). Moreover, vitamin D intake was also not associated with pancreatic cancer risk (RR=1.11, 95{\%} CI=0.67- 1.86) Conclusions: Our results indicate that high plasma 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with improved survival in pancreatic cancer patients. However, there were no significant associations between vitamin D intake or plasma 25(OH)D levels and pancreatic cancer risk.},

abstract = {Background: The association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), including aspirin, and risk of pancreatic cancer is controversial. We did a meta-analysis to summarize available evidence from epidemiologic studies investigating the relation between use of aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk of pancreatic cancer. Methods: We identified potential studies by searching the MEDLINE database (from 1966 to October 2006) and by reviewing the reference lists of pertinent publications. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) had a case-control or prospective design, (b) examined exposure to aspirin or NSAIDs, (c) the outcome was pancreatic cancer incidence or mortality, and (d) they provided a relative risk (RR) estimate with corresponding confidence interval or sufficient information to permit their calculation. Study-specific RR estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Results: A total of 11 studies (3 case-control studies, 7 cohort studies, and 1 randomized trial), involving 6,386 pancreatic cancer cases, was included in the meta-analysis. The summary RR estimate did not indicate any association between aspirin/NSAID use and risk of pancreatic cancer [any/regular use versus nonregular/never use: RR, 1.01; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 0.91-1.11; Pheterogeneity = 0.09]. Neither use of aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, nor overall NSAIDs were associated with pancreatic cancer risk. There was also no overall association with frequent (six or more tablets/times per week versus none: RR, 0.86; 95{\%} CI, 0.61-1.23) or long-term (≥20 years) use of aspirin (RR, 1.21; 95{\%} CI, 0.74-1.96). Conclusions: Current epidemiologic evidence does not indicate that use of aspirin or NSAIDs is associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Quantification of this risk provides a rational basis for cancer risk counseling and for screening for early pancreatic cancer. In a prospective registry-based study, we estimated the risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by comparing the number of incident pancreatic cancers observed with those expected using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) rates. Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) kindreds were defined as kindreds having at least one pair of first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, and sporadic pancreatic cancer (SPC) kindreds as families without such an affected pair. Nineteen incident pancreatic cancers developed among 5,179 individuals from 838 kindreds (at baseline, 370 FPC kindreds and 468 SPC kindreds). Of these 5,179 individuals, 3,957 had at least one first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer and contributed 10,538 person-years of follow-up. In this group, the observed-to-expected rate of pancreatic cancer was significantly elevated in members of FPC kindreds [9.0; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 4.5-16.1], but not in the SPC kindreds (1.8; 95{\%} CI., 0.22-6.4). This risk in FPC kindreds was elevated in individuals with three (32.0; 95{\%} CI, 10.2-74.7), two (6.4; CI, 1.8-16.4), or one (4.6; CI, 0.5-16.4) first-degree relative(s) with pancreatic cancer. Risk was not increased among 369 spouses and other genetically unrelated relatives. Risk was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. Individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer have a significantly increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.},

In a joint model with smoking, current smokers with non-O blood type had an adjusted OR of 2.68 (95{\%} CI, 2.03-3.54) compared with nonsmokers of blood type O. We concluded that ABO genotypes were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

abstract = {In a Swedish population, 361 patients with pernicious anemia were followed closely during a 7-year period with regard to the occurrence of all forms of malignant neoplasia. In addition to an increased incidence of gastric neoplasia (0.6{\%}/year), there seemed to be an increased incidence of pancreatic neoplasia (0.3{\%}/year) in the series. With reference to age- and sex-specific incidence rates in the general population, the number of malignant pancreatic tumors observed was significantly higher than expected (p{\textless}0.02, Poisson analysis). Pancreatic malignancy was the primary cause of death in 5 (4{\%}) of 134 patients who died during follow-up. Among 127 unselected patients with malignant pancreatic neoplasia, the prevalence of pernicious anemia was 3{\%}. These findings indicate that there is a linkage between the two diseases which has not been previously recognized. Atrophic gastritis with hypergastrinemia may be the key to this linkage. {\textcopyright} 1988 The Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} Internationale de Chirurgie.},

abstract = {Objective: In pancreatic cancer (PaC), the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially new-onset DM (≤36 months of PaC diagnosis), is high. To determine if this observation is unique to PaC, we compared the prevalence and characteristics of DM in lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers with PaC and noncancer controls. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 500 consecutive patients with cancer (100 each with lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers and PaC) and 100 noncancer controls. RESULTS: Patients with PaC (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.4 years; 53{\%} men) had a significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) higher prevalence of DM (68{\%}) compared to age-matched patients with lung (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.4 years; 59{\%} men; and 19.6{\%} DM), breast (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.6 years; 100{\%} women; and 19.4{\%} DM), prostate (mean age ± SD, 71.3 ± 9.4 years; 100{\%} men; and 14.8{\%} DM), and colorectal cancer (mean age ± SD, 71.6 ± 9.5 years; 56{\%} men; and 20.7{\%} DM), and noncancer controls (mean age ± SD, 70.7 ± 9.2 years; 57{\%} men; and 23.5{\%} DM). Among the patients with PaC, 40{\%} developed DM in the 36 months preceding the diagnosis of PaC compared with 3.3{\%} to 5.7{\%} in the other groups (P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the prevalence of DM in PaC is very high, DM prevalence in other common cancers is no different from that in noncancer controls. In particular, new-onset DM is a phenomenon that is unique to PaC. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

@article{Lowenfels1993,
abstract = {Background: The results of case-control studies and anecdotal reports suggest that pancreatitis may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but there have been no studies of sufficient size and power to assess the magnitude of the relation between these two diseases. Methods and Results: We undertook a multicenter historical cohort study of 2015 subjects with chronic pancreatitis who were recruited from clinical centers in six countries. A total of 56 cancers were identified among these patients during a mean (±SD) follow-up of 7.4 ±6.2 years. The expected number of cases of cancer calculated from country-specific incidence data and adjusted for age and sex was 2.13, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (the ratio of observed to expected cases) of 26.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 19.9 to 34.2). For subjects with a minimum of two or five years of follow-up, the respective standardized incidence ratios were 16.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 11.1 to 23.7) and 14.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 8.5 to 22.8). The cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer in subjects who were followed for at least 2 years increased steadily, and 10 and 20 years after the diagnosis of pancreatitis, it was 1.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.6 percent) and 4.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 5.9 percent), respectively. Conclusions: The risk of pancreatic cancer is significantly elevated in subjects with chronic pancreatitis and appears to be independent of sex, country, and type of pancreatitis., Many epidemiologic studies have been performed to detect risk factors for exocrine pancreatic cancer – a common and usually fatal gastrointestinal tumor. Smoking and reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables appear to be the best established risk factors for this tumor 1 – 9 . However, case-control studies and case reports have also implicated pancreatitis, a disease often seen in heavy drinkers, as a possible cause. Because of the limited number of cases of pancreatitis in most studies, the evidence linking these two pancreatic disorders is largely anecdotal 3 , 6 , 10 – 12 .

@article{Raimondi2010,
abstract = {Acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer are responsible for most of the burden of exocrine pancreatic disease. Glandular damage from recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis can lead to irreversible changes characteristic of chronic pancreatitis. In recent decades accumulating evidence has defined longstanding pre-existing chronic pancreatitis as a strong risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The lag period between diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is usually one or two decades: pancreatitis appearing a year or two before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is often the result of tumour-related ductal obstruction. The risk of developing pancreatic cancer appears to be highest in rare types of pancreatitis with an early onset, such as hereditary pancreatitis and tropical pancreatitis. Even though there is a strong link between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, over a 20 year period only around five percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop pancreatic cancer. Until the development of more sophisticated screening procedures, screening is not recommended for patients with chronic pancreatitis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Quantification of this risk provides a rational basis for cancer risk counseling and for screening for early pancreatic cancer. In a prospective registry-based study, we estimated the risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by comparing the number of incident pancreatic cancers observed with those expected using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) rates. Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) kindreds were defined as kindreds having at least one pair of first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, and sporadic pancreatic cancer (SPC) kindreds as families without such an affected pair. Nineteen incident pancreatic cancers developed among 5,179 individuals from 838 kindreds (at baseline, 370 FPC kindreds and 468 SPC kindreds). Of these 5,179 individuals, 3,957 had at least one first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer and contributed 10,538 person-years of follow-up. In this group, the observed-to-expected rate of pancreatic cancer was significantly elevated in members of FPC kindreds [9.0; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 4.5-16.1], but not in the SPC kindreds (1.8; 95{\%} CI., 0.22-6.4). This risk in FPC kindreds was elevated in individuals with three (32.0; 95{\%} CI, 10.2-74.7), two (6.4; CI, 1.8-16.4), or one (4.6; CI, 0.5-16.4) first-degree relative(s) with pancreatic cancer. Risk was not increased among 369 spouses and other genetically unrelated relatives. Risk was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. Individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer have a significantly increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {In this population-based retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the association between age at diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and the End Results database. Different factors for stratification, like race, sex, year of diagnosis, pathological grade, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, historic stage, and tumour location, were included to compare the survival rates of patients of different age groups, and the five-year survival rate was calculated. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression was performed to control for confounder bias, and the hazard ratio was calculated. In total, 126,066 patients were enrolled in this study. The five-year PC-specific survival of patients aged 20–40 years was almost three times that of patients aged {\textgreater}40 years. Stratified by race, sex, year of diagnosis, pathological grade, clinical stage, and tumour location, a descending trend of survival was observed with an increase in age. On multivariate analysis, the mortality risk of PC patients aged 40–80 years was twice that of patients aged {\textless}40 years; however, patients aged {\textgreater}80 years had a mortality risk three times that of patients aged {\textless}40 years. The survival rate of PC patients has improved in the last few decades.

abstract = {(1) Background: We investigated the incidence and survival trends for pancreatic cancer (PC) over the last 25 years in the Girona region, Catalonia, Spain; (2) Methods: Data were extracted from the population-based Girona Cancer Registry. Incident PC cases during 1994–2015 were classified using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology Third Edition (ICD-O-3). Incidence rates age-adjusted to the European standard population (ASRE) and world standard population (ASRW) were obtained. Trends were assessed using the estimated annual percentage of change (EAPC) of the ASRE13. Observed and relative survivals (RS) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier and Pohar Perme methods, respectively; (3) Results: We identified 1602 PC incident cases. According to histology, 44.4{\%} of cases were exocrine PC, 4.1{\%} neuroendocrine, and 51.1{\%} malignant-non-specified. The crude incidence rate (CR) for PC was 11.43 cases-per-100,000 inhabitants/year. A significant increase of incidence with age and over the study period was observed. PC overall 5-year RS was 7.05{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 5.63; 8.84). Longer overall survival was observed in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (5-year RS 61.45{\%}; 95{\%}CI 47.47; 79.55). Trends in 5-year RS for the whole cohort rose from 3.27{\%} (95{\%}CI 1.69–6.35) in 1994–1998 to 13.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 9.98; 17.2) in 2010–2015; (4) Conclusions: Incidence rates of PC in Girona have increased in the last two decades. There is a moderate but encouraging increase in survival thorough the study period. These results can be used as baseline for future research.},

abstract = {The JAK-STAT pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and embryological processes. Aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway due to genetic mutations, amplifications, or polymorphisms can lead to constitutive or persistent activation of the pathway and affect the development of some cancers. In this review, we discuss the major signaling molecules involved in the JAK-STAT pathway and their role in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In addition, we discuss FDA-approved drugs and other JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors that are in clinical trials or under preclinical development. Despite recent developments in our understanding of the JAK-STAT pathway, it remains to be determined precisely how the JAK-STAT pathway drives tumor development and oncogenic phenotypes. Due to the complex cross talk of the JAK-STAT pathway with other signaling pathways, further studies exploring the direct role and contribution of the JAK-STAT pathway toward tumor initiation and development are needed. These studies should illuminate whether treatment with JAK inhibitors alone or in combination with inhibitors that target complimentary signaling pathways can be therapeutic in cancer patients and which patients are most likely to benefit.},

abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been under careful investigation for a long period, and this signaling pathway is one of the most studied. MAPKs regulate cell proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways are a cascade of signaling enzymes starting with the transmission of a signal from a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) located on the cell surface to the nucleus and ending in the regulation of transcription of target genes. Due to its importance in human cancers, MAPK/ERK signaling pathways are attractive targets for cancer drug development. In this chapter, we will present the MAPK signaling pathway and outline the function of the most relevant protein mediators that facilitate signaling. We will also highlight negative regulators of the pathway, drugs designed to block signaling, and ongoing clinical trials.},

abstract = {Background: We projected cancer mortality statistics for 2018 for the European Union (EU) and its six more populous countries, using the most recent available data. We focused on colorectal cancer. Materials and methods: We obtained cancer death certification data from stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, bladder, leukaemia, and total cancers from the World Health Organisation database and projected population data from Eurostat. We derived figures for France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the EU in 1970-2012. We predicted death numbers by age group and age-standardized (world population) rates for 2018 through joinpoint regression models. Results: EU total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline by 10.3{\%} in men between 2012 and 2018, reaching a predicted rate of 128.9/100 000, and by 5.0{\%} in women with a rate of 83.6. The predicted total number of cancer deaths is 1 382 000 when compared with 1 333 362 in 2012 (+3.6{\%}). We confirmed a further fall in male lung cancer, but an unfavourable trend in females, with a rate of 14.7/100 000 for 2018 (13.9 in 2012,+5.8{\%}) and 94 500 expected deaths, higher than the rate of 13.7 and 92 700 deaths from breast cancer. Colorectal cancer predicted rates are 15.8/100 000 men (-6.7{\%}) and 9.2 in women (-7.5{\%}); declines are expected in all age groups. Pancreatic cancer is stable in men, but in women it rose+2.8{\%} since 2012. Ovarian, uterine and bladder cancer rates are predicted to decline further. In 2018 alone, about 392 300 cancer deaths were avoided compared with peak rates in the late 1980s. Conclusion: We predicted continuing falls in mortality rates from major cancer sites in the EU and its major countries to 2018. Exceptions are pancreatic cancer and lung cancer in women. Improved treatment and-above age 50 years-organized screening may account for recent favourable colorectal cancer trends.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, its toll is higher in more developed countries. Reasons for vast differences in mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are not completely clear yet, but it may be due to lack of appropriate diagnosis, treatment and cataloging of cancer cases. Because patients seldom exhibit symptoms until an advanced stage of the disease, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms that caused 432,242 new deaths in 2018 (GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates). Globally, 458,918 new cases of pancreatic cancer have been reported in 2018, and 355,317 new cases are estimated to occur until 2040. Despite advancements in the detection and management of pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate still stands at 9{\%} only. To date, the causes of pancreatic carcinoma are still insufficiently known, although certain risk factors have been identified, such as tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dietary factors, alcohol abuse, age, ethnicity, family history and genetic factors, Helicobacter pylori infection, non-O blood group and chronic pancreatitis. In general population, screening of large groups is not considered useful to detect the disease at its early stage, although newer techniques and the screening of tightly targeted groups (especially of those with family history), are being evaluated. Primary prevention is considered of utmost importance. Up-to-date statistics on pancreatic cancer occurrence and outcome along with a better understanding of the etiology and identifying the causative risk factors are essential for the primary prevention of this disease.},

abstract = {This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6{\%} of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4{\%} of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6{\%}), prostate cancer (7.1{\%}), and colorectal cancer (6.1{\%}) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2{\%}), stomach cancer (8.2{\%}), and liver cancer (8.2{\%}) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool to make accurate predictions from complex data such as image, text, or video. However, its ability to predict phenotypic values from molecular data is less well studied. Here, we describe the theoretical foundations of DL and provide a generic code that can be easily modified to suit specific needs. DL comprises a wide variety of algorithms which depend on numerous hyperparameters. Careful optimization of hyperparameter values is critical to avoid overfitting. Among the DL architectures currently tested in genomic prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem more promising than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A limitation of DL is in interpreting the results. This may not be relevant for genomic prediction in plant or animal breeding but can be critical when deciding the genetic risk to a disease. Although DL technologies are not ”plug-and-play”, they are easily implemented using Keras and TensorFlow public software. To illustrate the principles described here, we implemented a Keras-based code in GitHub.},

abstract = {Importance: There is a lack of studies exploring the performance of a deep learning survival neural network in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Objectives: To compare the performances of DeepSurv, a deep learning survival neural network with a tumor, node, and metastasis staging system in the prediction of survival and test the reliability of individual treatment recommendations provided by the deep learning survival neural network. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this population-based cohort study, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed and validated using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stages I to IV NSCLC between January 2010 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 127 features, including patient characteristics, tumor stage, and treatment strategies, were assessed for analysis. The algorithm was externally validated on an independent test cohort, comprising 1182 patients with stage I to III NSCLC diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2013 in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. Analysis began January 2018 and ended June 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The deep learning survival neural network model was compared with the tumor, node, and metastasis staging system for lung cancer-specific survival. The C statistic was used to assess the performance of models. A user-friendly interface was provided to facilitate the survival predictions and treatment recommendations of the deep learning survival neural network model. Results: Of 17 322 patients with NSCLC included in the study, 13 361 (77.1{\%}) were white and the median (interquartile range) age was 68 (61-74) years. The majority of tumors were stage I disease (10 273 [59.3{\%}]) and adenocarcinoma (11 985 [69.2{\%}]). The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 24 (10-43) months. There were 3119 patients who had lung cancer-related death during the follow-up period. The deep learning survival neural network model showed more promising results in the prediction of lung cancer-specific survival than the tumor, node, and metastasis stage on the test data set (C statistic = 0.739 vs 0.706). The population who received the recommended treatments had superior survival rates than those who received treatments not recommended (hazard ratio, 2.99; 95{\%} CI, 2.49-3.59; P {\textless} .001), which was verified by propensity score-matched groups. The deep learning survival neural network model visualization was realized by a user-friendly graphic interface. Conclusions and Relevance: The deep learning survival neural network model shows potential benefits in prognostic evaluation and treatment recommendation with respect to lung cancer-specific survival. This novel analytical approach may provide reliable individual survival information and treatment recommendations.},

abstract = {Objectives: To predict urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) using a deep learning (DL) model, which was then used to evaluate surgeon's historical patient outcomes. Subjects and Methods: Robotic surgical automated performance metrics (APMs) during RARP, and patient clinicopathological and continence data were captured prospectively from 100 contemporary RARPs. We used a DL model (DeepSurv) to predict postoperative urinary continence. Model features were ranked based on their importance in prediction. We stratified eight surgeons based on the five top-ranked features. The top four surgeons were categorized in ‘Group 1/APMs', while the remaining four were categorized in ‘Group 2/APMs'. A separate historical cohort of RARPs (January 2015 to August 2016) performed by these two surgeon groups was then used for comparison. Concordance index (C-index) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to measure the model's prediction performance. Outcomes of historical cases were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis, chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Continence was attained in 79 patients (79{\%}) after a median of 126 days. The DL model achieved a C-index of 0.6 and an MAE of 85.9 in predicting continence. APMs were ranked higher by the model than clinicopathological features. In the historical cohort, patients in Group 1/APMs had superior rates of urinary continence at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (47.5 vs 36.7{\%}, P = 0.034, and 68.3 vs 59.2{\%}, P = 0.047, respectively). Conclusion: Using APMs and clinicopathological data, the DeepSurv DL model was able to predict continence after RARP. In this feasibility study, surgeons with more efficient APMs achieved higher continence rates at 3 and 6 months after RARP.},

In this retrospective study including 255 patients suitable for analysis who underwent surgical treatment in our department from 2000 to 2017, we applied a deep learning-based survival prediction method in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients and validated its performance. Survival prediction using DeepSurv, a deep learning based-survival prediction algorithm, was compared with random survival forest (RSF) and the Cox proportional hazard model (CPH). DeepSurv showed the best performance among the three models, the c-index of the training and testing sets reaching 0.810 and 0.781, respectively, followed by RSF (0.770/0.764), and CPH (0.756/0.694). The performance of DeepSurv steadily improved with added features. Thus, deep learning-based survival prediction may improve prediction accuracy and guide clinicians both in choosing treatment options for better survival and in avoiding unnecessary treatments.},

abstract = {Background: To explore the prognostic value and the role for treatment decision of pathological microscopic features in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using the method of deep learning. Methods: The pathological microscopic features were extracted using the software QuPath (version 0.1.3. Queen's University) in the training cohort (Guangzhou training cohort, n = 843). We used the neural network DeepSurv to analyze the pathological microscopic features (DSPMF) and then classified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups through the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The prognosis accuracy of the pathological feature was validated in a validation cohort (n = 212). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: We found 429 pathological microscopic features in the H{\&}E image. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter 5-year PFS (HR 10.03, 6.06-16.61; P {\textless}.0001). The DSPMF (C-index: 0.723) had the higher C-index than the EBV DNA (C-index: 0.612) copies and the N stage (C-index: 0.593). Furthermore, induction chemotherapy (ICT) plus concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) had better 5-year PFS to those received CCRT (P {\textless}.0001) in the high-risk group. Conclusion: The DSPMF is a reliable prognostic tool for survival risk in patients with NPC and might be able to guide the treatment decision.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop and validate novel nomograms to predict recurrence and progression after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in Korean patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on 970 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients after TURBT between 2000 and 2013 in a single institution. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify the significant predictors of recurrence and progression, which resulted in the construction of the nomograms predicting the 5-year probability of recurrence and progression. We internally validated the nomograms using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics' curves and calibration plots. In addition, the clinical usefulness of each nomogram was assessed and compared with that of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-scoring system using decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: The significant factors related to recurrence were gross hematuria at diagnosis, previous or concomitant upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), pT1 tumor, high tumor grade, multiple tumors, and intravesical therapy. The significant predictors of progression were previous or concomitant UTUC, pT1 tumor, high tumor grade, carcinoma in situ, and lymphovascular invasion. The 5-year predictive accuracy of each nomogram was 65{\%} for recurrence and 70{\%} for progression, respectively. Compared with the EORTC-scoring system, the nomograms were generally well calibrated. On DCA, each nomogram presented better net benefit gains than did the EORTC-scoring system across a wide range of threshold probabilities. Conclusions: Our novel nomograms are not completely accurate, but they show a reasonable level of discriminative ability, adequate calibration, and meaningful net benefit gain for the prediction of recurrence and progression after TURBT in Korean NMIBC patients. Additional external validation will be required to generalize the nomograms which we developed.},

abstract = {Context: Urothelial carcinoma can exhibit a wide range of variant morphologies. Many variants present diagnostic challenges and carry clinical implications that inform prognosis and treatment decisions. Objective: To provide an overview of the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic significance of histological variants of urothelial carcinoma. Evidence acquisition: A PubMed/MEDLINE-based literature search was conducted using the key terms “urothelial carcinoma”, “variant histology”, “nested”, “micropapillary”, “microcystic”, “sarcomatoid”, “squamous differentiation”, “glandular differentiation”, “clear cell”, “plasmacytoid”, “lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma”, “squamous cell carcinoma”, “small cell carcinoma”, “adenocarcinoma”, “radiotherapy”, “neoadjuvant chemotherapy”, and “adjuvant chemotherapy”. Evidence synthesis: The incidence of variant histology is increasing due to improved recognition. Nonetheless, diagnosis can pose challenges due to sampling limitations and interobserver variability. Although associated with advanced disease at presentation, survival outcomes for most variants do not differ significantly compared with pure urothelial carcinoma of the same stage. Controversy exists regarding optimal management due to the low quality of available evidence. For most cases, radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection (with neoadjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate) represents the standard of care. Small cell carcinoma and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma appear to be particularly chemosensitive. Conclusions: Accurate identification of variant histological subtypes is an important part of risk stratification, as these variants exhibit aggressive biological behaviour. Variant histology tumours are associated with advanced disease at presentation, which must be considered when counselling patients regarding survival outcomes. Optimal management remains to be defined but in most cases; neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection remains the mainstay of treatment. Patient summary: It is important to recognise histological variants of urothelial carcinoma as they indicate aggressive disease. When compared with patients with pure urothelial carcinoma of the same disease stage, survival does not appear to be significantly worse. In most cases, patients with invasive variant histology should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy. Take Home Messages Accurate identification of variant histology is important as it exhibits aggressive biological behaviour and affects treatment. Although associated with advanced disease at presentation, with appropriate treatment, survival outcomes are not significantly different compared with pure urothelial carcinoma of the same stage.},

abstract = {Purpose: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is an important step in bladder cancer cell dissemination. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to assess the prognostic value of LVI in radical cystectomy (RC) specimens. Patients and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the last 10 years was performed using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane libraries in July 2017. The analyses were performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Results: We retrieved 65 studies (including 78,107 patients) evaluating the effect of LVI on oncologic outcomes in patients treated with RC. LVI was reported in 35.4{\%} of patients. LVI was associated with disease recurrence (pooled hazard ratio [HR] = 1.57; 95{\%} CI: 1.45–1.70) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) (pooled HR = 1.59; 95{\%} CI: 1.48–1.73) in all studies regardless of tumor stage and node status (pT1–4 pN0–2). LVI was associated with recurrence and CSM in patients with node-negative bladder cancer (BC). In patients with node-negative BC, LVI rate increased and was associated with worse oncologic outcome. LVI had a lower but still significant association with disease recurrence and CSM in node-positive BC. Conclusions: LVI is a strong prognostic factor of worse prognosis in patients treated with RC for bladder cancer. This association is strongest in node-negative BC, but it is also in node-positive BC. LVI should be part of all pathological reporting and could provide additional information for treatment-decision making regarding adjuvant therapy after RC.},

abstract = {The aim of the present review was to assess the prognostic impact of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in transurethral resection (TUR) of bladder cancer (BCa) specimens on clinical outcomes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature from the past 10 years was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library in August 2017. The protocol for this systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (Central Registration Depository: CRD42018084876) and is available in full on the University of York website. Overall, 33 studies (including 6194 patients) evaluating the presence of LVI at TUR were retrieved. LVI was detected in 17.3{\%} of TUR specimens. In 19 studies, including 2941 patients with ≤cT1 stage only, LVI was detected in 15{\%} of specimens. In patients with ≤cT1 stage, LVI at TUR of the bladder tumour (TURBT) was a significant prognostic factor for disease recurrence (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 1.97, 95{\%} CI: 1.47–2.62) and progression (pooled HR 2.95, 95{\%} CI: 2.11–4.13), without heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.0{\%}, P = 0.84 and I 2 = 0.0{\%}, P = 0.93, respectively). For patients with cT1–2 disease, LVI was significantly associated with upstaging at time of radical cystectomy (pooled odds ratio 2.39, 95{\%} CI: 1.45–3.96), with heterogeneity among studies (I 2 = 53.6{\%}, P = 0.044). LVI at TURBT is a robust prognostic factor of disease recurrence and progression in non-muscle invasive BCa. Furthermore, LVI has a strong impact on upstaging in patients with organ-confined disease. The assessment of LVI should be standardized, reported, and considered for inclusion in the TNM classification system, helping clinicians in decision-making and patient counselling.},

abstract = {Context: This overview presents the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), TaT1, and carcinoma in situ (CIS). Objective: To provide practical recommendations on the clinical management of NMIBC with a focus on clinical presentation and recommendations. Evidence acquisition: A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the NMIBC guidelines has been performed annually since the last published version in 2017. Databases covered by the search included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Previous guidelines were updated, and the level of evidence and grade of recommendation were assigned. Evidence synthesis: Tumours staged as Ta, T1, and/or CIS are grouped under the heading of NMIBC. Diagnosis depends on cystoscopy and histological evaluation of the tissue obtained by transurethral resection (TURB) in papillary tumours or by multiple bladder biopsies in CIS. In papillary lesions, a complete TURB is essential for the patient's prognosis and correct diagnosis. Where the initial resection is incomplete, where there is no muscle in the specimen, or where a T1 tumour is detected, a second TURB should be performed within 2–6 wk. The risks of both recurrence and progression may be estimated for individual patients using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring system. Stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups is pivotal to the recommendation of adjuvant treatment. In patients with tumours presumed to be at a low risk and in those presumed to be at an intermediate risk with a low previous recurrence rate and an expected EORTC recurrence score of {\textless}5, one immediate chemotherapy instillation is recommended. Patients with intermediate-risk tumours should receive 1 yr of full-dose bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy or instillations of chemotherapy for a maximum of 1 yr. In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG for 1–3 yr is indicated. In patients at the highest risk of tumour progression, immediate radical cystectomy should be considered. Cystectomy is recommended in BCG-unresponsive tumours. The extended version of the guidelines is available at the EAU website: https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/. Conclusions: These abridged EAU guidelines present updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of NMIBC for incorporation into clinical practice. Patient summary: The European Association of Urology Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) Panel has released an updated version of their guidelines, which contains information on classification, risk factors, diagnosis, prognostic factors, and treatment of NMIBC. The recommendations are based on the current literature (until the end of 2018), with emphasis on high-level data from randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses. Stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups is essential for deciding appropriate use of adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) instillations. Surgical removal of the bladder should be considered in case of BCG-unresponsive tumours or in NMIBCs with the highest risk of progression.},

Mutations of HRAS, FGFR3, PIK3CA and TERT were found in 2.9{\%}, 27.2{\%}, 14.9{\%} and 76.7{\%} of tumor samples, respectively. Concerning NMIBC, on multivariate analysis, RXRA and FGFR3 levels were associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.0022 and p = 0.0069) and RXRA level was associated with progression to muscle-invasive disease (p = 0.0068). We identified a 3-gene molecular signature associated with NMIBC prognosis. FGFR3 overexpression was associated with reduced response to Bacillus Calmette–Guerin treatment (p = 0.037). As regards MIBC, on multivariate analysis, ERCC2 overexpression was associated with RFS (p = 0.0011) and E2F3 and EGFR overexpression were associated with overall survival (p = 0.014 and p = 0.035). RT-PCR findings were confirmed by IHC for FGFR3. Genomic alterations in MIBC revealed in TCGA data also concern NMIBC and seem to be associated with prognosis in terms of recurrence and progression. Correcting these alterations by targeted therapies seems a promising pharmacological approach.},

@article{Uno2011,
abstract = {For modern evidence-based medicine, a well thought-out risk scoring system for predicting the occurrence of a clinical event plays an important role in selecting prevention and treatment strategies. Such an index system is often established based on the subject's 'baseline' genetic or clinical markers via a working parametric or semi-parametric model. To evaluate the adequacy of such a system, C-statistics are routinely used in the medical literature to quantify the capacity of the estimated risk score in discriminating among subjects with different event times. The C-statistic provides a global assessment of a fitted survival model for the continuous event time rather than focussing on the prediction of bit-year survival for a fixed time. When the event time is possibly censored, however, the population parameters corresponding to the commonly used C-statistics may depend on the study-specific censoring distribution. In this article, we present a simple C-statistic without this shortcoming. The new procedure consistently estimates a conventional concordance measure which is free of censoring. We provide a large sample approximation to the distribution of this estimator for making inferences about the concordance measure. Results from numerical studies suggest that the new procedure performs well in finite sample. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between patients' covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems. Methods: We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment recommendations. Results: We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients. Conclusions: The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure.},

abstract = {Context: This review focuses on the most widely used risk stratification and prediction tools for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Objective: To assess the clinical use and relevance of risk stratification and prediction tools to enhance clinical decision making and counselling of patients with NMIBC. Evidence acquisition: The most frequent, currently used risk stratification tools and prognostic models for NMIBC patients were identified by the members of the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Panel on NMIBC. Evidence synthesis: The 2006 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables are the most widely used and validated tools for risk stratification and prognosis prediction in NMIBC patients. The EAU risk categories constitute a simple alternative to the EORTC risk tables and can be used for comparable risk stratification. In the subgroup of NMIBC patients treated with a short maintenance schedule of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the Club Urol{\'{o}}gico Espa{\~{n}}ol de Tratamiento Oncol{\'{o}}gico (CUETO) scoring model is more accurate than the EORTC risk tables. Both the EORTC risk tables and the CUETO scoring model overestimate the recurrence and progression risks in patients treated according to current guidelines. The new concept of conditional recurrence and progression estimates is very promising during follow-up but should be validated. Conclusions: Risk stratification and prognostic models enable outcome comparisons and standardisation of treatment and follow-up. At present, none of the available risk stratification and prognostic models reflects current standards of treatment. The EORTC risk tables and CUETO scoring model should be updated with previously unavailable data and recalculated. Patient summary: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease. A risk-based therapeutic approach is recommended. We present available risk stratification and prediction tools and the degree of their validation with the aim to increase their use in everyday clinical practice. Risk stratification and prognostic models are of great importance because they enable standardisation of the treatment and follow-up, and data comparison. The low overall performance reflects the need for biomarkers that measure the biological potential of tumours.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate our long-term experience with patients treated uniformly with radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for invasive bladder cancer and to describe the association of the primary bladder tumor stage and regional lymph node status with clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods: All patients undergoing radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic iliac lymphadenectomy, with the intent to cure, for transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder between July 1971 and December 1997, with or without adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy, were evaluated. The clinical course, pathologic characteristics, and long-term clinical outcomes were evaluated in this group of patients. Results: A total of 1,054 patients (843 men [80{\%}] and 211 women) with a median age of 66 years (range, 22 to 93 years) were uniformly treated. Median follow-up was 10.2 years (range, 0 to 28 years). There were 27 (2.5{\%}) perioperative deaths, with a total of 292 (28{\%}) early complications. Overall recurrence-free survival at 5 and 10 years for the entire cohort was 68{\%} and 66{\%}, respectively. The 5- and 1O-year recurrence-free survival for patients with organ-confined, lymph node-negative tumors was 92{\%} and 86{\%} for PO disease, 91{\%} and 89{\%} for Pis, 79{\%} and 74{\%} for Pa, and 83{\%} and 78{\%} for Pl tumor, respectively. Patients with muscle invasive (P2 and PSa), lymph node-negative tumor had 91{\%} and 87{\%} and 78{\%} and 76{\%} {\$} and 10-year recurrence-free survival respectively. Patients with nonorgan-confined (P3b, P4), lymph node-negative tumors demonstrated a significantly higher probability of recurrence compared with those with organ-confined bladder cancers (P {\textless} .001). The 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival for P3b tumors was 69.{\%} and 61{\%}, and for P4 tumors was 50{\%} and 45{\%}, respectively. A total of 246 patients (24{\%}) had lymph node tumor involvement. The 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival for these patients was 35{\%}, and 34{\%}, respectively, which was significantly lower than for patients without lymph node involvement (P {\textless} .001). Patients could also be stratified by the number of lymph nodes involved and by the extent of the primary bladder tumor (p stage). Patient's with fewer than five positive lymph nodes, and whose p stage was organ-confined had significantly improved survival rates. Bladder cancer recurred in 311 patients (30{\%}) . The median time to recurrence among those patients in whom the cancer recurred was 12 months (range, 0.04 to 11. 1 years). In 234 patients (22.{\%}) there was a distant recurrence, and in 77 patients (7{\%}) there was a local (pelvic) recurrence. Conclusion: These data from a large group of patients support the aggressive surgical management of invasive bladder cancer long-lotto survival can be achieved with a low incidence of pelvic recurrence. {\textcopyright} 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

This trend could be encapsulated in this simple formula: D = S * F, where the volume of data generated (D) increases in both dimensions: the number of samples (S) and the number of sample features (F). Frequently, a typical omics classification includes redundant and irrelevant features (e.g. genes or proteins) that can result in long computation times; decrease of the model performance and the selection of suboptimal features (genes and proteins) after the classification/regression step. Multiple algorithms and reviews has been published to describe all the existing methods for feature selection, their strengths and weakness. However, the selection of the correct FS algorithm and strategy constitutes an enormous challenge. Despite the number and diversity of algorithms available, the proper choice of an approach for facing a specific problem often falls in a ‘grey zone'. In this study, we select a subset of FS methods to develop an efficient workflow and an R package for bioinformatics machine learning problems. We cover relevant issues concerning FS, ranging from domain's problems to algorithm solutions and computational tools. Finally, we use seven different proteomics and gene expression datasets to evaluate the workflow and guide the FS process.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. However, the amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of genes. We have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method. The stand-alone and web versions of the Wx algorithm are available at https://github.com/deargen/DearWXpub and https://wx.deargendev.me/, respectively.},

abstract = {Background: Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection. Results: We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy. Conclusions: Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Diaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andres, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The improved method, which we call SPSA-FSR, dramatically reduces the number of iterations required for convergence without impacting solution quality. SPSA-FSR can be used for feature ranking and feature selection both for classification and regression problems. After a review of the current state-of-the-art, we discuss our improvements in detail and present three sets of computational experiments: (1) comparison of SPSA-FS as a (wrapper) feature selection method against sequential methods as well as genetic algorithms, (2) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a classification setting against random forest importance, chi-squared, and information main methods, and (3) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a regression setting against minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), RELIEF, and linear correlation methods. The number of features in the datasets we use range from a few dozens to a few thousands. Our results indicate that SPSA-FS converges to a good feature set in no more than 100 iterations and therefore it is quite fast for a wrapper method. SPSA-FS also outperforms popular feature selection as well as feature ranking methods in majority of test cases, sometimes by a large margin, and it stands as a promising new feature selection and ranking method.},

Previous research has demonstrated that this technology can be useful in the classification of cancers. Cancer microarray data normally contains a small number of samples which have a large number of gene expression levels as features. To select relevant genes involved in different types of cancer remains a challenge. In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, nave Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence.

abstract = {The increasing availability and use of predictive models to facilitate informed decision making highlights the need for careful assessment of the validity of these models. In particular, models involving biomarkers require careful validation for two reasons: issues with overfitting when complex models involve a large number of biomarkers, and interlaboratory variation in assays used to measure biomarkers. In this article, we distinguish between internal and external statistical validation. Internal validation, involving training-testing splits of the available data or cross-validation, is a necessary component of the model building process and can provide valid assessments of model performance. External validation consists of assessing model performance on one or more data sets collected by different investigators from different institutions. External validation is a more rigorous procedure necessary for evaluating whether the predictive model will generalize to populations other than the one on which it was developed. We stress the need for an external data set to be truly external, that is, to play no role in model development and ideally be completely unavailable to the researchers building the model. In addition to reviewing different types of validation, we describe different types and features of predictive models and strategies for model building, as well as measures appropriate for assessing their performance in the context of validation. No single measure can characterize the different components of the prediction, and the use of multiple summary measures is recommended. {\textcopyright}2008 American Association for Cancer Research.},

The stability of the selected lists of features is an often neglected but very important requirement. If the same features are selected in multiple independent iterations, they more likely are reliable biomarkers. In this study, we developed and evaluated the performance of a novel method for feature selection and prioritization, aiming at generating robust and stable sets of features with high predictive power. The proposed method uses the fuzzy logic for a first unbiased feature selection and a Random Forest built from conditional inference trees to prioritize the candidate discriminant features. Analyzing several multi-class gene expression microarray data sets, we demonstrate that our technique provides equal or better classification performance and a greater stability as compared to other Random Forest-based feature selection methods.},

They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). {\^{a}} €f In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

We proposed a new in silico approach of finding a suitable reference for human, circulating miRNAs and identified a new set of endogenous reference miRNA based on miRNA profiling experiments from Gene Expression Omnibus. We used 3 known normalization algorithms (NormFinder, BestKeeper, GeNorm) to calculate a new normalization score. We searched for a universal set of endogenous miRNAs and validated our findings on 2 new datasets using our approach. Results: We discovered and validated a set of 13 miRNAs (miR-222, miR-92a, miR-27a, miR-17, miR-24, miR-320a, miR-25, miR-126, miR-19b, miR-199a-3p, miR-30b, miR-30c, miR-374a) that can be used to create a reliable reference combination of 3 miRNAs. We showed that on average the mean of 3 miRNAs (p = 0.0002) and 2 miRNAs (p = 0.0031) were a better reference than single miRNA. The arithmetic means of 3 miRNAs: miR-24, miR-222 and miR-27a was shown to be the most stable combination of 3 miRNAs in validation sets. Conclusions: No single miRNA was suitable as a universal reference in serum miRNA qPCR profiling, but it was possible to designate a set of miRNAs, which consistently contributed to most stable combinations.},

abstract = {Effective planning for the medical response to a radiological or nuclear accident is complex. Because of limited resources for medical countermeasures, the key would be to accurately triage and identify victims most likely to benefit from treatment. We used a mouse model system to provide evidence that serum microRNAs (miRNAs) may effectively predict the impact of radiation on the long-term viability of animals. We had previously used nonhuman primates (NHPs) to demonstrate that this concept is conserved and serum miRNA signatures have the potential to serve as prediction biomarkers for radiation-induced fatality in a human population. We identified a signature of seven miRNAs that are altered by irradiation in both mice and NHPs. Genomic analysis of these conserved miRNAs revealed that there is a combination of seven transcription factors that are predicted to regulate these miRNAs in human, mice, and NHPs. Moreover, a combination of three miRNAs (miR-133b, miR-215, and miR-375) can identify, with nearly complete accuracy, NHPs exposed to radiation versus unexposed NHPs. Consistent with historical data, female macaques appeared to be more sensitive to radiation, but the difference was not significant. Sex-based stratification allowed us to identify an interaction between gender and miR-16-2 expression, which affected the outcome of radiation exposure. Moreover, we developed a classifier based on two miRNAs (miR-30a and miR-126) that can reproducibly predict radiation-induced mortality. Together, we have obtained a five-miRNA composite signature that can identify irradiated macaques and predict their probability of survival.},

abstract = {Accidental radiation exposure is a threat to human health that necessitates effective clinical planning and diagnosis. Minimally invasive biomarkers that can predict long-term radiation injury are urgently needed for optimal management after a radiation accident. We have identified serum microRNA (miRNA) signatures that indicate long-term impact of total body irradiation (TBI) in mice when measured within 24 hours of exposure. Impact of TBI on the hematopoietic system was systematically assessed to determine a correlation of residual hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with increasing doses of radiation. Serum miRNA signatures distinguished untreated mice from animals exposed to radiation and correlated with the impact of radiation on HSCs. Mice exposed to sublethal (6.5 Gy) and lethal (8 Gy) doses of radiation were indistinguishable for 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. A serum miRNA signature detectable 24 hours after radiation exposure consistently segregated these two cohorts. Furthermore, using either a radioprotective agent before, or radiation mitigation after, lethal radiation, we determined that the serum miRNA signature correlated with the impact of radiation on animal health rather than the radiation dose. Last, using humanized mice that had been engrafted with human CD34+ HSCs, we determined that the serum miRNA signature indicated radiation-induced injury to the human bone marrow cells. Our data suggest that serum miRNAs can serve as functional dosimeters of radiation, representing a potential breakthrough in early assessment of radiation-induced hematopoietic damage and timely use of medical countermeasures to mitigate the long-term impact of radiation.},

abstract = {Background: Risk of normal tissue toxicity limits the amount of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) that can be routinely prescribed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An early biomarker of response to thoracic RT may provide a way to predict eventual toxicities-such as radiation pneumonitis-during treatment, thereby enabling dose adjustment before the symptomatic onset of late effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were studied as potential serological biomarkers for thoracic RT. As a first step, we sought to identify miRNAs that correlate with delivered dose and standard dosimetric factors. Methods: We performed miRNA profiling of plasma samples obtained from five patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC at five dose-points each during radical thoracic RT. Candidate miRNAs were then assessed in samples from a separate cohort of 21 NSCLC patients receiving radical thoracic RT. To identify a cellular source of circulating miRNAs, we quantified in vitro miRNA expression intracellularly and within secreted exosomes in five NSCLC and stromal cell lines. Results: miRNA profiling of the discovery cohort identified ten circulating miRNAs that correlated with delivered RT dose as well as other dosimetric parameters such as lung V20. In the validation cohort, miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were reproducibly shown to decrease with increasing radiation dose. Expression of miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p in secreted exosomes decreased with radiation. This was concomitant with an increase in intracellular levels, suggesting that exosomal export of these miRNAs may be downregulated in both NSCLC and stromal cells in response to radiation. Conclusions: miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were identified as circulating biomarkers that correlated with delivered RT dose. miR-150 has been reported to decrease in the circulation of mammals exposed to radiation while miR-29a has been associated with fibrosis in the human heart, lungs, and kidneys. One may therefore hypothesize that outlier levels of circulating miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p may eventually help predict unexpected responses to radiation therapy, such as toxicity.},

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic potential of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels after breast cancer radiation therapy (RT) for incipient cardiac dysfunction. Methods and Materials: In this single-centered study, we prospectively enrolled female patients treated for left breast cancer. Healthy age- and sex-matched participants were recruited as controls. LBP levels, cardiac troponin T, N-terminal propeptide of the brain natriuretic peptide, fatty acid binding protein, and C-reactive protein were assessed at three timepoints—before RT, after the last RT fraction, and 1 month after the last fraction. Echocardiographic evaluation was done 3 to 3.75 years after RT. Results: We recruited 51 patients and 78 controls. Baseline LBP concentrations in the study group were significantly higher than in controls at baseline (P {\textless}.001), at 24 hours, and at 1 month after RT (P =.003 and P {\textless}.001, respectively). Other biomarkers (cardiac troponin T, N-terminal propeptide of the brain natriuretic peptide, fatty acid binding protein, and C-reactive protein) did not differ in any of the timepoints. Posttreatment LBP concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with heart- and lung-associated dose-volume histogram variables. Posttreatment and follow-up LBP levels correlated positively with the E/Eʹ echocardiographic index reflective of the diastolic function. After adjustment for left anterior descending artery mean dose, left ventricle mean dose, mean heart dose, and type of surgery, LBP remained significantly correlated with E/Eʹ when measured 24 hours after RT (beta = 0.41, P =.032) and 1 month after RT (beta = 0.43, P =.028). Conclusions: Serum LBP concentrations correlate with diastolic function evaluated 3 years after the completion of RT, making LBP a potentially useful prognostic parameter.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the clinical correlates and prognostic utility of MMP, VEGF and TIMP genes expression in bladder cancer (BCa) recurrence. Methods: Expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, VEGFA and TIMP1, TIMP3 was analyzed by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of BCa patients at two time points (diagnosis (n =40), and first recurrence (n = 40)) and an age-matched group of healthy controls (n = 100). Plasma concentrations of MMP1 (pro- and active forms) were measured using ELISA in BCa patients. Results: The expression of MMP1 mRNA was significantly lower in BCa patients with first recurrence compared to control ( p= 0.019). Expression of other genes did not differ significantly between the groups. MMP9 gene expression was associated with differentiation grade ( p= 0.043), with the highest expression in poorly differentiated tumors (G3) and was higher in smokers than in non-smokers ( p= 0.039) in BCa patients at diagnosis. The results at two time points showed that MMP9 and VEGFA genes expression was increased in patients with moderately differentiated BCa ( p= 0.029), and advanced pathologic stage ( p= 0.048), respectively. Moreover, gene expression of TIMP1 was increased for G3 ( p= 0.043), and was decreased for early recurrence ( p= 0.003). Conclusions: Our study suggests that the expression of MMP9 in PBLs of BCa patients at diagnosis is associated with the differentiation grade of the BCa, and smoking status. Genes expression of MMP9, VEGFA and TIMP1 in PBLs may play a pivotal role in regulation of progression of BCa. Additionally, TIMP1 gene expression may be important factor for early recurrence of BCa.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Four distinct disease courses are known, although approximately 90 {\%} of patients are diagnosed with the relapsing-remitting form (RRMS). The name “multiple sclerosis” pertains to the underlying pathology: the presence of demyelinating plaques in the CNS, in particular in the periventricular region, corpus callosum, cervical spine, and the cerebellum. There are ongoing efforts to discover biomarkers that would allow for an unequivocal diagnosis, assess the activity of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes, or warn of disease progression. At present, small noncoding RNA particles-microRNA (miRNA, miR) seem to be particularly noteworthy, as they take part in posttranscriptional regulation of expression of various genes. Changes in composition as well as function of miRNA found in body fluids of MS patients are subjects of research, in the hope they prove accurate markers of MS activity. This preliminary study aims to evaluate the expression of selected extracellular microRNA particles (miRNA-let-7a, miRNA-92a, miRNA-684a) in patients experiencing MS relapse and remission, with healthy volunteers serving as a control group and to evaluate the correlation between miRNA expression and selected clinical parameters of those patients. Thirty-seven patients suffering from MS formed two examined groups: 20 patients undergoing relapse and 17 in remission. Thirty healthy volunteers formed the control group. All patients who were subjects to peripheral blood sampling had been hospitalized in the Department of Neurology and Stroke1. Four milliliters of venous whole blood had been collected into EDTA tubes. The basis for the selection of the three particular miRNA investigated in this study (miRNA-let-7a, miRNA-92a, miRNA-684a) was a preliminary bioinformatic analysis of data compiled from several medical databases, including Ovid MEDLINE{\textregistered}, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), miRWalk, and miRBase. The isolation of extracellular microRNA from plasma was carried out using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) reagents. The reverse transcription was carried out with TaqMan{\textregistered} MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), as per manufacturers' instructions. Standard microRNA TaqMan{\textregistered} tests (Applied Biosystems) were used for miRNA quantification. The qPCR were performed on a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using Sequence Detection System 2.3 software. In addition, all patients at the Department of Neurology and Stroke undergo a routine complete blood count with differential. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of selected microRNA (has-miR-let-7a, miR-92a, and miR-648a) in the plasma of patients with MS during a relapse as well as in remission and attempt to correlate the acquired data with clinically relevant parameters of the disease. Finding such correlations may potentially lead to the use of miRNA as a biomarker of MS, which could help diagnose the disease and assess its severity and the efficacy of treatment. The difference in the expression of has-miR-let-7a in the remission group and the control group was statistically significant (p = 0.002). Similarly, the expression of miRNA-648a in patients in remission was significantly different from the expression in the control group (p = 0.02). Analysis of the correlation between the expression of miRNA-92a and the severity of the disease as measured by the EDSS scale in patients undergoing relapse showed significant negative linear correlation (r = −0.54, p = 0.01). Higher miR-648a expression correlated with more frequent flare-ups in the joint group of patients in remission and relapse (p = 0.03). This study is one of the few that demonstrate significantly changed expression of selected extracellular miRNA in plasma of MS patients and correlate those findings with clinical parameters. These observations may suggest that some miRNA subsets may be potential biomarkers for MS activity.},

Material and methods: the study group included 36 patients aged 35-78 years old. At diagnosis, PSV, EDV, RI and PI in uterine arteries were examined and compared with MRI findings. All patients underwent transvaginal doppler ultrasonography prior to the treatment, after external beam radiation therapy and six weeks after the last application of brachytherapy. Results: The median PSV value in the first examination was higher in infiltrated uterine arteries than compared to non-infiltrated ones (p = 0.001). The PSV values for all vessels decreased between the first and the third observation (p {\textless} 0.001). There was a significant difference in PI values between infiltrated and non-infiltrated uterine arteries between the first and the third examination (p = 0.027). Conclusions: In patients with locally advanced cervical cancer of uterine arteries, assessment of PSV but not EDV, RI or PI can be helpful in differentiating infiltrated from non-infiltrated vessels. In this group of patients, radiotherapy decreases PSV, but not EDV, RI or PI values in uterine arteries. An observation conducted from the onset of radiotherapy to end of the follow-up in uterine arteries reveals that PI, but not RI, PSV or EDV, is different in infiltrated and non-infiltrated vessels.},

This study aimed to determine whether gene expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1 and TIMP3 and the MMP/TIMP expression ratio in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and the MMP1 and TIMP1 contents or MMP1/TIMP1 ratio in plasma were associated with clinicopathological characteristics in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected from women newly diagnosed with IDC who had not received prior treatment (n = 102). Gene expression in PBLs was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Concentrations of MMP1 and TIMP1 in plasma were measured using ELISA. Results: In univariate analysis the expression levels of MMP2 and TIMP1 mRNA were significantly higher in premenopausal compared to postmenopausal patients (p{\textless}0.001 and p = 0.014, respectively). MMP2 mRNA expression negatively correlated with age (p{\textless}0.001, r =-0.43). We found that the MMP2/TIMP3 expression ratio was significantly higher in women after menopause (p = 0.007). The MMP2/TIMP1 expression ratio was higher in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive patients (p = 0.022). Low-grade tumors had significantly lower MMP1/TIMP1 and MMP2/TIMP1 expression ratios (p = 0.047 and p = 0.048, respectively). TIMP1 plasma concentration was significantly higher in small tumors compared with T2-T3 tumors (p = 0.013). Conclusions: These findings reveal an important association between tumor characteristics and expression ratios of MMP1/TIMP1 and MMP2/TIMP1 in PBLs and TIMP1 concentration in plasma. Menopausal status may influence the mRNA expression levels of MMP2 and TIMP1 as well as the MMP2/TIMP3 expression ratio in IDC of the breast.},

Subjects and Methods: Diluted U10 insulin was started in three children 3.8, 3.2, and 1.3 years old with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level (mean±SD) of 8.1±0.17{\%} (65±1.7mmol/mol) and insulin dose of 8.80±2.93 units/day. Patients were evaluated with continuous glucose monitoring (iPro™2; Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA) and a quality of life questionnaire (PedsQL™; www.pedsql.org/) and surveyed for pump-related problems at baseline and after 3 and 9 months of U10 insulin therapy. Results: Continuous glucose monitoring records showed that glycemic variability assessed by SD and M100 decreased significantly (P=0.0085 and P=0.0482, respectively).

abstract = {Background: Platelet hyperreactivity is a factor which contributes towards increased risk of cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, little is known about platelets' disturbances among children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The aim of the study was to investigate whether platelets' morphology or function are altered in children with type 1 diabetes, potentially predisposing them to cardiovascular events in the future. Methods: The study group consisted of 389 children with T1DM during the 2008-2010 period. Patients with acute diabetes complications and ongoing infections were excluded from the study. An equinumerous (N = 389), age and sex-matched control group was assembled from children undergoing routine, minor surgical procedures in the same hospital. Platelet: count (PLT), mean volume (MPV), distribution width (PDW) and platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) as well as HbA1c levels were measured. For statistical analysis we used Chi-square tests, the student's t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression models in order to adjust for covariates. Results: MPV, PDW and P-LCR were significantly higher among children with diabetes in comparison with the control group (MPV 10.47+/-0.85 fL vs 10.23+/-0.94 fL, p = 0.0007; PDW 12.09+/-1.80{\%} vs 11.66+/-1.90{\%}, p = 0.0032; P-LCR 28.21+/-6.15{\%} vs 26.29+/-6.38{\%}, p {\textless} 0.0001). PLT however, were shown to be similar (263.55+/-60.04 vs 268.77+/-65.78 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/$\mu$l; p = 0.5637). In both cases and controls age was inversely correlated with platelet count (for study group: r = -0.30, p {\textless} 0.0001; for control group: r = -0.34, p {\textless} 0.0001), positively correlated with MPVs (r = 0.20, p {\textless} 0.0001; r = 0.26, p {\textless} 0.0001), PDW (r = 0.25, p {\textless} 0.0001 and r = 0.24, p {\textless} 0.0001) and P-LCR (r = 0.26, p {\textless} 0.0001; r = 0.26, p {\textless} 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, higher platelet counts were associated with poorer metabolic control (beta = 0.20; 0.0001). Conclusions: Platelets of paediatric patients with T1DM show morphological evidence of hyperreactivity (higher MPV, PDW and P-LCR), while poorer metabolic control increases their number potentially predisposing the patients to future cardiovascular events.},

In this study, we investigated whether rs3824662 in GATA3 associates with CRLF2 expression in leukemic cells and predicts prognosis in pediatric BCP-ALL patients treated according to the ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-M{\"{u}}nster (IC BFM) 2009 (n = 645) and the ALL IC BFM 2002 (n = 216) protocols. High expression of CRLF2 was observed at both protein and mRNA levels (fourfold higher in AA than in CA + CC) among GATA3 AA variant carriers, independent of the presence of P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion. Additionally, the AA variant at rs3824662 was a significant factor affecting minimal residual disease level at the end of induction phase and overall survival regardless of the risk group and the protocol. The germline variant at rs3824662 in GATA3 is a prognostic factor which associates with CRLF2 expression in leukemic cells supporting the hypothesis that GATA3 may have a regulatory effect on the CRLF2 pathway in pediatric BCP-ALL.},

abstract = {Due to tremendous technological advances, radiation oncologists are now capable of personalized treatment plans and deliver the dose in a highly precise manner. However, a crucial challenge is how to escalate radiation doses to cancer cells while reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. This determines the probability of achieving therapeutic success whilst safeguarding patients from complications. The current dose constraints rely on observational data. Therefore, incidental toxicity observed in a minority of patients limits the admissible dose thresholds for the whole population, theoretically narrowing down the curative potential of radiotherapy. Future tools for measurements of individual's radiosensitivity before and during treatment would allow proper treatment personalization. Variation in tissue tolerance is at least partially genetically-determined and recent progress in the field of molecular biology raises the possibility that novel assays will allow to predict the response to ionizing radiation. Recently, microRNAs have garnered interest as stable biomarkers of tumor radiation response and normal-tissue toxicity. Preclinical studies in mice and nonhuman primates have shown that serum circulating microRNAs can be used to accurately distinguish pre- and postirradiation states and predict the biological impact of high-dose irradiation. First reports from human studies are also encouraging, however biology-driven precision radiation oncology, which tailors treatment to individual patient's needs, still remains to be translated into clinical studies. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the potential of serum microRNAs as biodosimeters and biomarkers for radiation injury to lung and hematopoietic cells.},

abstract = {Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis are entities that may, due to the similarity of clinical symptoms, cause diagnostic difficulties. Incidence rate of both diseases is similar and estimated between 1:25,000 and 1:40,000. The genes associated with the development of the aforementioned disorders are located on chromosome 22 and lay in proxmity. Schwannomatosis is characterized by an incomplete penetrance and the risk of its transmission to the offspring is significantly lower than in the case of NF 2. Schwannomatosis clinical characteristic is similar to the NF2, however vestibular schwannomas are not present. Therefore the imaging studies evaluated by an experienced radiologist play a key role in the diagnostic process. Case report Forty two-year-old female hospitalized three times because of the tumors of the spinal canal was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery and Peripheral Nerve Surgery in 2008 because of the cervical pain syndrome with concomitant headache. She was diagnosed with a schwannomatosis, recently distinguished, the third form of neurofibromatosis. MRI imaging revealed craniocervical junction tumor. Suboccipital craniectomy with concomitant C1-C2 laminectomy was done in order to remove the lesion. After the surgery the patient did not present any deficits in neurological examination and was discharged from hospital in good general condition. Conclusions The patient was diagnosed with schwannomatosis, recently established neurofibromatosis entity which may resemble NF2 clinically. In patients after the age of 30, in whom we observe multiple schwannomas without the concomitant hearing impairment, the diagnosis of schwannomatosis is very likely.},

abstract = {Introduction: One of the most recent methods used in imaging of the larynx is narrow band imaging (NBI). NBI enables us to detect specific patterns of pathological angiogenesis suggestive of premalignant or neoplastic lesions. The aim of the study was to compare imaging of laryngeal lesions in white light endoscopy (WLE) and NBI in relation to histopathological examination. Material and methods: 333 patients with laryngeal lesions underwent endoscopic evaluation in WLE and NBI. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) for WLE and NBI were calculated. The diagnostic value for WLE and NBI was evaluated for two assumptions (positive result is:1. severe dysplasia and cancer 2. only cancer) Results: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of first assumption were respectively for white light compared to NBI: 95.4{\%} vs 98.5{\%}; 84.2{\%} vs 98.5{\%}; 79.6{\%} vs 97.7{\%} and 96.6{\%} vs 99.0{\%}. The values of second assumption were: 97.4{\%} vs 100{\%}; 79.3{\%} vs 93.5{\%}; 72.6{\%} vs. 89.4{\%} and 98.2{\%} vs. 100.0{\%}. Higher sensitivity was observed for the second assumption, while higher specifity was recorded for the first assumption. Specificity was significantly higher for NBI than for WLE (p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: NBI enables us to detect and differentiate laryngeal lesions, which are invisible in WLE. Endoscopic examination, especially in NBI-mode, is non-invasive, repeatable and remains a useful tool in the daily practice and diagnosis of patients with pathological lesions in the larynx.},

abstract = {There is ongoing research with the goal of finding precise and sensitive biomarkers of multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, researchers have paid particular attention to small, non-encoding, single stranded endogenous microRNA molecules (miR, miRNA). At first these molecules were thought to be found only within the cell. Today it is known, however, that they can also be found in the extracellular spaces (plasma, serum, saliva, urine, tears, sweat, milk, sperm and amniotic fluid, among others). It has been established that extracellular miRNA perform a wide spectrum of functions, such as transmitting signals between cells, modulating processes involved in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, proliferation or apoptosis. Given the high stability of these small molecules in the extracellular compartment (plasma), their tissue specificity and strong ties with pathological processes underlying multiple sclerosis, miRNA seem to be a good target for researchers trying to discover diseases' new markers. Determining an accurate miRNA expression profile in MS and correlating it with the gene profile may lead to the discovery of new pathophysiological processes. Demonstrating that changes in the composition and concentration of extracellular miRNA may in some cases correlate with certain aspects of the underlying disease (such as its severity) could lead to their use as biomarkers of MS. Further research is needed.},

Recent studies have suggested that the level of isoprostanes in cerebrospinal fluid could play a role in outcomes of patients with aSAH. We measured concentration of urinary F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs), which is simple and noninvasive. Methods A prospective analysis was performed of clinical data and urine samples of 20 patients with aSAH who underwent microsurgical clipping of the aneurysmal neck between May 2016 and January 2017. The role of F2-IsoPs as a CVS biomarker was analyzed with regard to clinical conditions of patients. Outcome was assessed at discharge and 1-month and 4-month follow-up using the Glasgow Outcome Scale and modified Rankin Scale. Results The concentration of urinary F2-IsoPs was significantly greater in patients with aSAH than in healthy control subjects (P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, increased F2-IsoP levels on day 3 after aSAH were associated with development of CVS (P = 0.015) and worse neurologic performance after 1 month (P = 0.042) and 4 months (P = 0.027). The prognostic value of urinary F2-IsoPs on day 3 in terms of CVS was found to be high (area under the curve 0.864, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.691–1.000). Conclusions Urinary F2-IsoPs may be used as a noninvasive prognostic biochemical marker in patients with aSAH. F2-IsoP levels in urine may have significant implications in pathogenesis of CVS.},

We assessed the discrepancies in the metabolic control between these groups by comparing mean H b A 1 c extracted from each study and the differences between actual and targeted H b A 1 c. Results. We included 105 from 1365 searched studies. The median (IQR) H b A 1 c for the study population was 8.30{\%} (8.00{\%}-8.70{\%}) and was lower in "6.5{\%}" than in "7.5{\%}" as targeted H b A 1 c level (8.20{\%} (7.85{\%}-8.57{\%}) versus 8.40{\%} (8.20{\%}-8.80{\%}); p = 0.028).

Case Description: We present a case of a 28-year-old man with a 35-mm tumor of the pineal region. Considering the typical radiological and pathologic presentation, the tumor was first diagnosed as pineocytoma. However, despite first total resection, the tumor recurred after 7 years. The recurrent neoplasm was composed mainly of papillary structures with low-grade atypical cells positive for CKAE1/AE3 and CK18. This categorization led to the final diagnosis of PTPR. The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy, which vastly improved his neurologic condition and resulted in significant tumor regression. Conclusions: This case exemplifies that PTPRs can perfectly mimic pineocytomas and simple staining for cytokeratins may warrant correct diagnosis and better treatment.},

Coil embolization is associated with a high recanalization rate and thus usage of flow diverter (FD) could constitute the treatment of choice. Although implementation of FD is very effective, it carries a significant risk of complications. The goal of our study was to find a radiological recanalization marker in order to facilitate decision process which would result in fewer treatment-related complications and in this way, to personalize endovascular therapy. We made a retrospective analysis of seventy-five patients with saccular carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms treated endovascularly. Morphometric measurements were performed in CTA 3D aneurysm models. The aneurysm size and volume were measured on the base of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. The treatment effectiveness was determined visually using the modified Raymond Roy classification after embolization and on the 6- and 12-month follow-up DSA. Statistica 13.1 software was used. Multivariate analyses showed that the aneurysm neck size (OR 2.51; 95{\%}CI: 1.20–5.26), aspect ratio (OR 2.60; 95{\%}CI: 1.27–5.21) and neck to parent artery ratio (OR 2.68; 95{\%}CI: 1.26–5.70) were risk factors for carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms recanalization after 6 months. Of those factors, aneurysm neck size remained the only significant risk factor for carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms recanalization after 12 months (OR 5.23, 95{\%}CI: 1.71–15.93). Various factors seem to influence recanalization. Preoperatively, if the above-mentioned predictors of recanalization are present, coiling is burdened with a high recanalization rate. In those cases, FD embolization should be considered.},

abstract = {Thyroid surgery is the most commonly performed procedure in the field of endocrine surgery. Studies are still ongoing on the development of a single algorithm for diagnosis and care of patients at risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. The aim of the study was to determine the biochemical marker that would allow the most accurate diagnosis of patient groups at risk of developing hypoparathyroidism and to identify risk factors for this disorder. Material and methods. The prospective study included 142 consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign goiter from January 1st 2014 to December 31st 2015. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), and magnesium (Mg) levels have been measured preoperatively and at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. Results. Clinical symptoms of hypoparathyroidism developed in 25 (17.6{\%}) of 142 patients. The best diagnostic accuracy for hypoparathyroidism based on ROC curves was obtained for iPTH at 6h (AUC 0.942; 95{\%} CI: 0.866-1.000, p{\textless}0.001) and its percentage change from baseline $\Delta$iPTH at 6h (AUC 0.930; 95{\%} CI: 0.858-1.000, p{\textless}0.001). In an multivariate analysis, the preoperative Ca level higher by 0.1 mmol/l, and iPTH level higher by 0.1 pmol/l were associated with a lower risk of hypoparathyroidism, by 68{\%} (p=0.012) and 61{\%} (p=0.007), respectively. A 1{\%} decline in iPTH from baseline increased the risk of hypoparathyroidism by 15{\%} (p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions. The most reliable markers indicating a high risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism are the decline in $\Delta$iPTH at 6h by {\textgreater} 65{\%} or iPTH level at 6h {\textless}1.57 pmol /l. A postoperative decline in iPTH levels is an independent risk factor for the development of hypoparathyroidism. Preoperative higher concentrations of Ca and iPTH are protective factors for the development of this disorder.},

All ROTs from Poland (n = 154) were invited to complete the survey. The survey consisted of 30 questions and regarded aspects such as satisfaction from training, cooperation with the supervisor, and education. During the study period, 105 ROTs from 22 Polish cities responded (the response rate was 68{\%}). Almost 85{\%} were satisfied with the choice of specialty, 43{\%} with training and 81{\%} with the teaching place. Clinical cooperation with the supervisor was described as difficult by 25{\%}. With education, 38{\%} of responders experienced obstacles and another 25{\%} stated that educational cooperation with their supervisor was none. “Good practice” understood as treatment according to the latest guidelines or internal protocols were reported by 71{\%}. Obligatory traineeships were shorter than recommended according to 67{\%} of the responders, usually due to shortage of medical staff. Almost two-thirds of ROTs work only in clinics, while 34{\%} perform both clinical and scientific work. The responders suggested that the introduction of organ-specified courses is an appropriate modification of the current program. Noteworthy, current diagnostic imaging and physics courses are not sufficient for the majority of participants (81{\%} and 80{\%}, respectively). Radiation oncology training is conducted relatively well in Poland. Some hospitals need to improve clinical and educational cooperation between trainees and their supervisors.},

Methods: This prospective study was carried out between 2011 and 2015. One hundred and thirty-three patients diagnosed with moderate to severe HV underwent a SCARF corrective osteotomy. We divided the patients into two groups according to their BMI: normal and overweight. Postoperative follow-up was two years. All patients were examined twice by two medical doctors simultaneously: pre-operatively and post-operatively at two years' follow-up. Data collected included biometrical records, X-rays [HV angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal Index (AOFAS-HMI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and satisfaction]. Results: There was a significant difference between patient age (p = 0.001), age at onset (p {\textless} 0.001) and AOFAS-HMI (p = 0.035) at follow-up. Other parameters were similar in both groups.

abstract = {{\textless}b{\textgreater}Introduction.{\textless}/b{\textgreater} Posterior circulation aneurysms account for approximately 30{\%} of all intracranial aneurysms, and their rupture often causes aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Because surgical treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms is difficult, endovascular treatment is commonly indicated. However, simple coil embolization is associated with a high rate of recanalization. Our goal was to investigate morphometric aneurysmal features assessed on pre-embolization computed tomography angiography (CTA) as predictors of recanalization in patients with posterior circulation aneurysms. {\textless}b{\textgreater}Material and Methods.{\textless}/b{\textgreater} We retrospectively analyzed data of 24 patients who underwent coil embolization due to rupture of saccular posterior circulation aneurysms. The morphometric features of aneurysms were measured based on pre-embolization 3D-CTA-aneurysm models, and aneurysmal size and volume were measured on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. The effectiveness of initial endovascular treatment was determined visually with the modified Raymond Roy classification directly after embolization and on follow-up DSAs. Recanalization was diagnosed when, compared to the primary embolization aneurysm appearance, compaction and filling of the aneurysm occurred. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica 13.1 software. {\textless}b{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}/b{\textgreater} Higher maximal aneurysm height perpendicular to the aneurysmal neck was associated with a greater aneurysm recanalization risk (12.12±5.13mm vs. 7.41±3.97mm, p=0.039), and this relationship remained significant after adjustment for patient's age, sex and aneurysm localization (OR=1.26, 95{\%}CI: 1.01-1.60, p=0.047). Maximal aneurysm height perpendicular to the aneurysmal neck distinguished well between recanalized and non-recanalized aneurysms (AUC=0.755, 95{\%}CI: 0.521- 0.989, p=0.033). {\textless}b{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/b{\textgreater}.

abstract = {Background: Using a cross-database integrative approach, we performed an epidemiological analysis in a representative region of central Poland to evaluate the availability of radiotherapy (RTx) and overall survival of adult patients undergoing RTx for cancer. Methods: Epidemiological data on cancer incidence in the 2005-2012 period were obtained from the Nationwide Cancer Registry. Using data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, we collected survival information of all patients treated in the only centre providing RTx for a region inhabited by approximately 2.6 million people. Results: After filtering out individuals on the basis of exclusion criteria, the final dataset covered 17,736 patients. Availability of RTx increased marginally, from 23.5{\%} (2005) to 24.4{\%} (2011, R=0.39, p=0.38), with the highest values noted in patients with cervical (78.5{\%}), prostate (70.6{\%}) and breast cancer (62.7{\%}). However, due to the decreasing population of the region, we noted increasing disparity in the likelihood of receiving RTx depending on the patient's area of residence, with rural areas becoming progressively more neglected. The best prognosis was noted among patients with breast or prostate cancer with 5-year OS rates reaching 81.2{\%} and 83.3{\%}, respectively. Multivariate analysis controlling for type of diagnosis and patient age showed a time-dependent improvement in outcomes (HR(95{\%} CI): 0.96(0.94-0.98); p{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions: Availability of RTx in Poland is still below that reported by developed European centres. Survival of patients undergoing radical RTx has gradually improved, although it is still below that of leading RTx departments, potentially due to delayed diagnosis or organisational barriers, necessitating further investigations.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Parameters that will help to identify patients with better and worse  prognosis are sought in subjects with locally advanced squamous cell cervical carcinoma. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the relationship between squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) concentration and the risk of relapse in patients with squamous cell cervical carcinoma staged IIB-IIIB. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 52 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma staged II B (n = 39) and IIIB (n = 13). Serum SCC-Ag concentration was assessed prior to radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy and four weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The follow-up after treatment ranged from 1 to 33 months (16.2 ±10.5). During follow-up, nine relapses were diagnosed (17.3{\%}). The concentration of SCC-Ag before the treatment was elevated in 41 cases (78.8{\%}) and in 11 cases (21.2{\%}) it was ≤ 2 ng/ml. In all the patients with relapses SCC-Ag concentration before the treatment was elevated. Relapses were diagnosed in five patients with elevated SCC-Ag concentration after the treatment (55.6{\%}) and in four patients with normal SCC-Ag concentration after the treatment (9.3{\%}). There was a positive correlation between SCC-Ag concentration before and after the treatment and relapse occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of serum SCC-Ag concentration in patients with locally advanced squamous cell cervical carcinoma before treatment is a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool and patients with high SCC-Ag concentration are at an increased risk of relapse. Due to the relationship between elevated serum SCC-Ag concentration after treatment and increased risk of relapse, these patients may require a more intensive post-treatment follow-up.},

This pilot study included 26 patients with NSCLC who received total radiation doses ranging from 54 to 74 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction). Cytokines were measured at baseline by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, and following administration of total doses of 20 and 40 Gy. A control group of 26 participants was sampled for comparisons with patient baseline cytokine levels. Only data from the 40-Gy cytokine blood levels of patients with NSCLC were identified to be correlated with histograms of the parameters of each patient's radiotherapy protocol. The IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$ and CRP median baseline levels of the patients with NSCLC were significantly higher than those of the controls (all P≤0.01). No differences were observed between the LBP levels of the patients and controls [median, 36.34 (25-75{\%}; 31.35-39.27) vs. 36.92 (30.20-44.05) $\mu$g/ml, respectively; P=0.42]. No significant differences in the levels of the four cytokines between baseline, and at 20 and 40 Gy were observed [IL-6 (P=0.19); TNF-$\alpha$ (P=0.68); CRP (P=0.44) and LBP (P=0.29)]. LBP was significantly and positively correlated with the mean radiation dose to the lung (r=0.409; P=0.038), and showed a positive correlation with the percentage of lung volume exposed to at least 20 Gy of the planned radiation dose (r=0.3536; P=0.0764). CRP levels were positively correlated with the mean radiation dose to the esophagus (r=0.404; P=0.041); however, IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$ and CRP were not significantly associated with other lung dosimetry parameters. Thus, LBP levels were correlated with radiation exposure of pulmonary tissues, and LBP may be a marker that warrants further investigation on radiotoxicity in NSCLC patients.},

A number of studies have been conducted to identify prognostic factors in patients treated for LGG. The present study evaluated the treatment outcomes as well as prognostic factors and their impact on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We retrospectively reviewed 30 consecutive patients treated for LGG at the Department of Radiotherapy from February 2008 to July 2011. The patients underwent surgical intervention and postoperative radiotherapy. The response to radiotherapy was evaluated from six to eight weeks after the end of treatment using MRI analysis. Kaplan-Maier analysis was used for OS and DFS estimation. The endpoint was mortality as a result of any cause. Within a median follow-up of 21.8 months, 9 patients (30{\%}) with disease progression were reported. The two- and five-year DFS and OS was 85.2 and 68.3{\%} for DFS, and 84.3 and 63.4{\%} for OS, respectively. The response to radiotherapy, evaluated in an MRI study, was found to be highly correlated with OS (p{\textless}0.0001). We also observed a significantly higher OS in patients with disease progression treated with salvage chemotherapy after the end of radiotherapy (p=0.08). Improved outcome among patients with LGG may be predicted by response to radiotherapy evaluated by MRI following termination of treatment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Spandidos Publications Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Anal and rectal cancers occupy the third position of death causes in Poland. Adenocarcinoma is the most frequent among the tumours in this group. Squamous cell carcinoma can be relatively less common. This kind of carcinoma may rather affect the anus than the rectum. Although the lesion is perceived as not very malignant and as such responsive to radiant energy therapy, some cases may require surgical treatment. Methods: Within 1999-2008 (the observation period of 10 years) there were 18 patients treated for anal squamous cell carcinoma at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, General and Oncological Surgery of the Medical University of Lodz, at the Surgical Department of the Ministry of Interior and Administration Hospital in Lodz and at the Teleradiotherapy Department of Mikolaj Kopernik Voivodship Specialist Hospital in Lodz. Each patient underwent radiochemotherapy with Mitomycin and 5-Fluorouracil and Lucovorin. The applied radiation doses ranged between 45-54 Gy in eighteen 2.0 Gy fractions. The abdomino-perineal resection of the rectum (APR) was performed in 3 patients (16.5{\%}) who did not show full regression of the carcinoma. In all three cases the histopathological diagnosis preceded the surgical procedure. Results: For the total number of 18 patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma the mean observation period was 5.5 years, in the group of the operated patients the mean survival rate was 48 months (the median of 14-74 months) while for the group of the patients treated conservatively the mean survival rate amounted to 55 months (the median of 17-82 months, p=0.23). The mean 5-year disease-free survival rate was rather similar to the same rate of the general group, whereas the post-operative complications occurred in 66{\%} of surgical procedures and 27{\%} of teleradiotherapeutic procedures. Conclusions: Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be the method of choice in treating anal squamous cell carcinoma. Surgery should be used in advanced cases, when complete regression on radiochemotherapy cannot be observed. The abdomino-perineal resection of the rectum is the kind of a procedure that may be accompanied with a vast number of complications. Nevertheless, it still remains a necessary therapeutic method in the described cases. Copyright {\textcopyright} Celsius.},

abstract = {The increasing incidence of obesity in Poland and its relation to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) is resulting in the increasing necessity of treating obese women. Treatment of an overweight patient with EEC may impede not only the surgical procedures but also radiotherapy, especially external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The problems arise both during treatment planning and when delivering each fraction due to the difficulty of positioning such a patient - it implies the danger of underdosing targets and overdosing organs at risk. Willingness to use dynamic techniques in radiation oncology has increased for patients with EEC, even those who are obese. During EBRT careful daily verification is necessary for both safety and treatment accuracy. The most accurate method of verification is cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with soft tissue assessment, although it is time consuming and often requires a radiation oncologist. In order to improve the quality of such treatment, the authors present the practical aspects of planning and treatment itself by means of dynamic techniques in EBRT. The authors indicate the advantages and disadvantages of different types of on-board imaging (OBI) verification images. Considering the scanty amount of literature in this field, it is necessary to conduct further research in order to highlight proper planning and treatment of obese endometrial cancer patients. The review of the literature shows that all centres that wish to use EBRT for gynaecological tumours should develop their own protocols on qualification, planning the treatment and methods of verifying the patients' positioning.},

abstract = {Aim: To investigate the correlation between the appearance of skin lesions and concentration of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-23 and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) in Crohn's disease (CD) patients during anti-tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) therapy Methods: A prospective study included 30 adult patients with CD of Caucasian origin (19 men and 11 women; mean age ± SD 32.0 ± 8.6 years) during biological therapy with anti-TNF-$\alpha$ antibodies from January 2012 to March 2013. Eighteen patients were treated with infliximab, seven with adalimumab and five with certolizumab. Inclusion criteria were exacerbation of the underlying disease, Crohn's Disease Activity Index over 300 and the ineffectiveness of previously used non-biological therapies. Patients with a history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and other autoimmune skin lesions were excluded from the study. The control group consisted of 12 healthy subjects. A diagnostic survey was carried out, blood tests and careful skin examination were performed, and the serum levels of IL-17, IL-23 and IFN-$\gamma$ were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays technique. Dermatoses that have developed in the course of biological therapy in patients who had no pre-existing skin lesions of similar character were qualified as skin lesions induced by anti- TNF-$\alpha$ therapy. Results: Skin manifestations occurred in 18 of CD patients during the anti-TNF-$\alpha$ therapy (60{\%}), in the average time of 10.16 ± 3.42 mo following the beginning of the 52-wk treatment cycle. Skin lesions observed in CD patients during biological therapy included psoriasiform lesions (44.4{\%}), and eczema forms lesions (22.2{\%}). In CD patients with drug induced skin lesions significantly higher levels of hemoglobin (13.3 ± 1.5 g/dL vs 10.8 ± 1.9 g/dL, P = 0.018) and hematocrit (39.9{\%} ± 4.5{\%} vs 34.3{\%} ± 5.4{\%}, P = 0.01), as well as a significantly lower level of platelets (268 ± 62 × 103/$\mu$L vs 408 ± 239 × 103/$\mu$L, P = 0.046) was observed compared with CD patients without skin manifestations. The concentrations of IL-17A and IL-23 in CD patients with skin lesions developed under anti- TNF-$\alpha$ therapy were significantly higher compared to those in patients without lesions (IL-17A: 39.01 ± 7.03 pg/mL vs 25.71 ± 4.90 pg/mL, P = 0.00004; IL-23: 408.78 ± 94.13 pg/mL vs 312.15 ± 76.24 pg/mL, P = 0.00556). Conclusion: Skin lesions in CD patients during bio-logical therapy may result from significantly increased concentrations of IL-17A and IL-23, which are strongly associated with TNF-$\alpha$/Th1 immune pathways. {\textcopyright} 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

abstract = {Purpose: Brachytherapy (BT), due to rapid dose fall off and minor set-up errors, should be superior to external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for treatment of lesions in difficult locations like nose and earlobe. Evidences in this field are scarce. We describe computed tomography (CT) based surface mould BT for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), and compare its conformity, dose coverage, and tissue sparing ability to EBRT. Material and methods: We describe procedure of preparation of surface mould applicator and dosimetry parameters of BT plans, which were implemented in 10 individuals with NMSC of nose and earlobe. We evaluated dose coverage by minimal dose to 90{\%} of planning target volume (PTV) (D90), volumes of PTV receiving 90-150{\%} of prescribed dose (PD) (VPTV90-150), conformal index for 90 and 100{\%} of PD (COIN90, COIN100), dose homogeneity index (DHI), dose nonuniformity ratio (DNR), exposure of organs. Prospectively, we created CT-based photons and electrons plans. We compared conformity (COIN90, COIN100), dose coverage of PTV (D90, VPTV90, VPTV100), volumes of body receiving 10-90{\%} of PD (V10-V90) of EBRT and BT plans. Results: We obtained mean BT-DHI = 0.76, BT-DNR = 0.23, EBRT-DHI = 1.26. We observed no significant differences in VPTV90 and D90 between BT and EBRT. Mean BT-VPTV100 (89.4{\%}) was higher than EBRT-VPTV100 (71.2{\%}). Both COIN90 (BT-COIN90 = 0.46 vs. EBRT-COIN90 = 0.21) and COIN100 (BT-COIN100 = 0.52 vs. EBRT-COIN100 = 0.26) were superior for BT plans. We observed more exposure of normal tissues for small doses in BT plans (V10, V20), for high doses in EBRT plans (V70, V90). Conclusions: Computed tmography-based surface mould brachytherapy for superficial lesions on irregular surfaces is a highly conformal method with good homogeneity. Brachytherapy is superior to EBRT in those locations in terms of conformity and normal tissue sparing ability in high doses.},

abstract = {Background: The IOM report, Preventing Medication Errors, emphasizes the overall lack of knowledge of the incidence of adverse drug events (ADE). Operating rooms, emergency departments and intensive care units are known to have a higher incidence of ADE. Labor and delivery (L{\&}D) is an emergency care unit that could have an increased risk of ADE, where reported rates remain low and under-reporting is suspected. Risk factor identification with electronic pattern recognition techniques could improve ADE detection rates. Objective: The objective of the present study is to apply Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE) as an enhanced sampling method in a sparse dataset to generate prediction models to identify ADE in women admitted for labor and delivery based on patient risk factors and comorbidities. Results: By creating synthetic cases with the SMOTE algorithm and using a 10-fold cross-validation technique, we demonstrated improved performance of the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and the decision tree algorithms. The true positive rate (TPR) of 0.32 in the raw dataset increased to 0.67 in the 800{\%} over-sampled dataset. Conclusion: Enhanced performance from classification algorithms can be attained with the use of synthetic minority class oversampling techniques in sparse clinical datasets. Predictive models created in this manner can be used to develop evidence based ADE monitoring systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from unbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy. {\textcopyright} 2002 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. However, the amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of genes. We have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method. The stand-alone and web versions of the Wx algorithm are available at https://github.com/deargen/DearWXpub and https://wx.deargendev.me/, respectively.},

abstract = {Background: Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection. Results: We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy. Conclusions: Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Diaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andres, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This manuscript presents the following: (1) an improved version of the Binary Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) Method for feature selection in machine learning (Aksakalli and Malekipirbazari, Pattern Recognition Letters, Vol. 75, 2016) based on non-monotone iteration gains computed via the Barzilai and Borwein (BB) method, (2) its adaptation for feature ranking, and (3) comparison against popular methods on public benchmark datasets. The improved method, which we call SPSA-FSR, dramatically reduces the number of iterations required for convergence without impacting solution quality. SPSA-FSR can be used for feature ranking and feature selection both for classification and regression problems. After a review of the current state-of-the-art, we discuss our improvements in detail and present three sets of computational experiments: (1) comparison of SPSA-FS as a (wrapper) feature selection method against sequential methods as well as genetic algorithms, (2) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a classification setting against random forest importance, chi-squared, and information main methods, and (3) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a regression setting against minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), RELIEF, and linear correlation methods. The number of features in the datasets we use range from a few dozens to a few thousands. Our results indicate that SPSA-FS converges to a good feature set in no more than 100 iterations and therefore it is quite fast for a wrapper method. SPSA-FS also outperforms popular feature selection as well as feature ranking methods in majority of test cases, sometimes by a large margin, and it stands as a promising new feature selection and ranking method.},

abstract = {Background: Gene selection is an important part of microarray data analysis because it provides information that can lead to a better mechanistic understanding of an investigated phenomenon. At the same time, gene selection is very difficult because of the noisy nature of microarray data. As a consequence, gene selection is often performed with machine learning methods. The Random Forest method is particularly well suited for this purpose. In this work, four state-of-the-art Random Forest-based feature selection methods were compared in a gene selection context. The analysis focused on the stability of selection because, although it is necessary for determining the significance of results, it is often ignored in similar studies.Results: The comparison of post-selection accuracy of a validation of Random Forest classifiers revealed that all investigated methods were equivalent in this context. However, the methods substantially differed with respect to the number of selected genes and the stability of selection. Of the analysed methods, the Boruta algorithm predicted the most genes as potentially important.Conclusions: The post-selection classifier error rate, which is a frequently used measure, was found to be a potentially deceptive measure of gene selection quality. When the number of consistently selected genes was considered, the Boruta algorithm was clearly the best. Although it was also the most computationally intensive method, the Boruta algorithm's computational demands could be reduced to levels comparable to those of other algorithms by replacing the Random Forest importance with a comparable measure from Random Ferns (a similar but simplified classifier). Despite their design assumptions, the minimal optimal selection methods, were found to select a high fraction of false positives. {\textcopyright} 2014 Kursa; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most common forms of malignant tumors and causes of tumor-related death worldwide. The current prognosis of PC still remains poor due to the lack of effective early detection method. Recently, there is strong support that circulating miRNAs can be used as biomarkers for early detection of various cancers, including PC. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of previous published studies on circulating miRNAs in plasma/serum for early detection of PC and summarize their diagnostic value. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched for eligible studies on circulating miRNAs for PC detection. Overall, 29 studies published between 2009 and 2018 evaluating 51 individual miRNAs (no P-value exceeding 0.05) and 13 miRNAs panels were included. Generally, the diagnostic performance of circulating miRNAs for PC detection was strong, with both the sensitivity and specificity of 36{\%} individual miRNAs and 40{\%} miRNAs panels exceeding 80{\%}. Moreover, two promising miRNA panels were discovered and verified externally with all AUC values exceeding 0.95. Therefore, circulating miRNAs may hold potential to be used as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for PC, but large-scale studies are still needed to validate the promising miRNAs and optimize the miRNA panels. Since, the tremendous heterogeneity of studies in this field hampers translating miRNA markers into clinical practice, miRNA analytical procedures are also needed to be standardized in the future.},

In this study, we investigated serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as a possible early screening tool for resectable lung cancer. First, we used serum samples from participants with and without lung cancer to comprehensively create 2588 miRNAs profiles; next, we established a diagnostic model based on the combined expression levels of two miRNAs (miR-1268b and miR-6075) in the discovery set (208 lung cancer patients and 208 non-cancer participants). The model displayed a sensitivity of 99{\%} and specificity of 99{\%} in the validation set (1358 patients and 1970 non-cancer participants) and exhibited high sensitivity regardless of histological type and pathological TNM stage of the cancer. Moreover, the diagnostic index markedly decreased after lung cancer resection. Thus, the model we developed has the potential to markedly improve screening for resectable lung cancer.},

The aggressive nature and late diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, coupled with the limitations of existing chemotherapy, present the pressing need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Recent reports have demonstrated a critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Furthermore, aberrant expressions of miRNAs have often been associated with the cause and consequence of pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the possible use of miRNAs in the effective management of pancreatic cancer patients. In this review, we provide a brief overview of miRNA biogenesis and its role in fundamental cellular process and miRNA studies in pancreatic cancer patients and animal models. Subsequent sections narrate the role of miRNA in, (i) cell cycle and proliferation; (ii) apoptosis; (iii) invasions and metastasis; and (iv) various cellular signaling pathways. We also describe the role of miRNA's in pancreatic cancer; (i) diagnosis; (ii) prognosis and (iii) therapeutic intervention. Conclusion section describes the gist of review with future directions.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (≈22 nt) regulatory RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. We show here that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. miRNAs originating from human prostate cancer xenografts enter the circulation, are readily measured in plasma, and can robustly distinguish xenografted mice from controls. This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of miR-141 (a miRNA expressed in prostate cancer) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls. Our results establish the measurement of tumor-derived miRNAs in serum or plasma as an important approach for the blood-based detection of human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) contribute to over 300,000 deaths every year worldwide. Although the survival rates have improved in some groups of patients, mostly due to new treatment options and the increasing percentage of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers, local recurrences and second primary tumors remain a great challenge for the clinicians. Presently, there is no biomarker for patient surveillance that could help identify patients with HNSCC that are more likely to experience a relapse or early progression, potentially requiring closer follow-up or salvage treatment. MicoRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally modulate gene expression. They are highly stable and their level can be measured in biofluids including serum, plasma, and saliva, enabling quick results and allowing for repeated analysis during and after the completion of therapy. This has cemented the role of miRNAs as biomarkers with a huge potential in oncology. Since altered miRNA expression was described in HNSCC and many miRNAs play a role in radio- and chemotherapy resistance, cancer progression, and metastasis, they can be utilized as biomarkers of these phenomena. This review outlines recent discoveries in the field of extracellular miRNA-based biomarkers of HNSCC progression and metastasis, with a special focus on HPV-related cancers and radioresistance.},

abstract = {Background: The understanding of the molecular biology of pediatric neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial brain tumors is still insufficient due to low frequency and heterogeneity of those lesions which comprise several subtypes presenting neuronal and/or neuronal-glial differentiation. Important is that the most frequent ganglioglioma (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) showed limited number of detectable molecular alterations. In such cases analyses of additional genomic mechanisms seem to be the most promising. The aim of the study was to evaluate microRNA (miRNA) profiles in GGs, DNETs and pilocytic asytrocytomas (PA) and test the hypothesis of plausible miRNA connection with histopathological subtypes of particular pediatric glial and mixed glioneronal tumors. Methods: The study was designed as the two-stage analysis. Microarray testing was performed with the use of the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array technology in 51 cases. Validation set comprised 107 samples used during confirmation of the profiling results by qPCR bioinformatic analysis. Results: Microarray data was compared between the groups using an analysis of variance with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure used to estimate false discovery rates. After filtration 782 miRNAs were eligible for further analysis. Based on the results of 10 × 10-fold cross-validation J48 algorithm was identified as the most resilient to overfitting. Pairwise comparison showed the DNETs to be the most divergent with the largest number of miRNAs differing from either of the two comparative groups. Validation of array analysis was performed for miRNAs used in the classification model: miR-155-5p, miR-4754, miR-4530, miR-628-3p, let-7b-3p, miR-4758-3p, miRPlus-A1086 and miR-891a-5p. Model developed on their expression measured by qPCR showed weighted AUC of 0.97 (95{\%} CI for all classes ranging from 0.91 to 1.00). A computational analysis was used to identify mRNA targets for final set of selected miRNAs using miRWalk database. Among genomic targets of selected molecules ZBTB20, LCOR, PFKFB2, SYNJ2BP and TPD52 genes were noted. Conclusions: Our data showed the existence of miRNAs which expression is specific for different histological types of tumors. miRNA expression analysis may be useful in in-depth molecular diagnostic process of the tumors and could elucidate their origins and molecular background.},

abstract = {Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a life-threatening condition characterized by growing incidence worldwide, particularly in the aging population, in which the primary goal of treatment appears to be avoidance of chronic institutionalization. Methods: To identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality or vegetative state in a geriatric population and calculate an intuitive scoring system, we screened 480 patients after TBI treated at a single department of neurosurgery over a 2-year period. We analyzed data of 214 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years, including demographics, medical history, cause and time of injury, neurologic state, radiologic reports, and laboratory results. A predictive model was developed using logistic regression modeling with a backward stepwise feature selection. Results: The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission was 14 (interquartile range, 12–15), whereas the 30-day mortality or vegetative state rate amounted to 23.4{\%}. Starting with 20 predefined features, the final prediction model highlighted the importance of GCS motor score (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.09–0.32); presence of comorbid cardiac, pulmonary, or renal dysfunction or malignancy (OR, 2.86; 9 5{\%} CI, 1.08–7.61); platelets ≤100 × 109 cells/L (OR, 13.60; 95{\%} CI, 3.33–55.49); and red blood cell distribution width coefficient of variation ≥14.5{\%} (OR, 2.91; 95{\%} CI, 1.09–7.78). The discovered coefficients were used for nomogram development. It was further simplified to facilitate clinical use. The proposed scoring system, Elderly Traumatic Brain Injury Score (eTBI Score), yielded similar performance metrics. Conclusions: The eTBI Score is the first scoring system designed specifically for older adults. It could constitute a framework for clinical decision-making and serve as an outcome predictor. Its capability to stratify risk provides reliable criteria for assessing efficacy of TBI management.},

abstract = {Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic value of skull fracture (SF) remains to be clearly defined. To evaluate the need for neurosurgical intervention and determine the risk factors of conservative treatment failure (CTF), we retrieved from the hospital database the records of patients with SF after TBI. Methods: We analyzed 146 consecutive patients (mean age: 49.8 ± 17.5 years) treated at the department of neurosurgery in a 5-year period. Clinical data, radiologic reports, and laboratory results were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 63{\%} of patients were treated conservatively, 21.9{\%} were operated on immediately, and 15.1{\%} experienced CTF. Overall, 73.3{\%} had a favorable outcome; the mortality rate was 13{\%}. Intracranial bleeding occurred in 96.6{\%} of cases, basilar SF in 61{\%}, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in 2.8{\%}. The independent risk factors for outcome were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, and platelet count (PCT). The independent risk factors for CTF were epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, mass effect, edema, international normalized ratio, PCT, mean platelet volume, and CSF leakage. The consensus decision tree algorithm used at the accident and emergency department indicated patients with no need for neurosurgical intervention with an accuracy of 91.7{\%}, sensitivity of 88.9{\%}, and featured the importance of mass effect, GCS, and epidural hematoma. Conclusions: Tests included in the complete blood count appeared useful for predicting the course in patients with SF, although the most important factors were age and neurologic status, as well as radiologic findings. Our decision tree requires further validation before it can be used in everyday practice.},

abstract = {Background: Direct measurement of insulin sensitivity in children with type 1 diabetes is cumbersome and time consuming. Objective: The aim of our study was to develop novel, accurate machine learning-based methods of insulin resistance estimation in children with type 1 diabetes. Methods: A hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp study was performed to evaluate the glucose disposal rate (GDR) in a study group consisting of 315 patients aged 7.6 to 19.7 years. The group was randomly divided into a training and independent testing set for model performance assessment. GDR was estimated on the basis of simple clinical variables using 2 non-linear methods: artificial neural networks (ANN) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSplines). The results were compared against the most frequently used predictive model, based on waist circumference, triglyceride (TG), and HbA1c levels. Results: The reference model showed moderate performance (R 2 = 0.26) with a median absolute percentage error of 49.1{\%}, and with the worst fit observed in young (7-12 years) children (R 2 = 0.17). Predictions of the MARSplines model were significantly more accurate than those of the reference model (median error 3.6{\%}, R 2 = 0.44 P {\textless}.0001). The predictions of the ANN, however, showed significantly lower error than those of the reference model (P {\textless}.0001) and MARSplines (P {\textless}.0001) and better fit regardless of patient age. ANN-estimated GDRs were within a ±20{\%} error range in 75{\%} of cases with a median error of 0.6{\%} and an R 2 = 0.66. The predictive tool is available at http://link.konsta.com.pl/gdr. Conclusions: The developed GDR estimation model reliant on ANN allows for an optimized prediction of GDR for research and clinical purposes.},

abstract = {Ibrutinib and idelalisib, B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway inhibitors, have been recently approved for use against relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To assess the efficacy and safety of BCR pathway inhibitors in relapsed/refractory CLL, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials (1866 patients). Our study demonstrated that BCR pathway inhibitors significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; pooled HR = 0.24; 95{\%} CI: 0.19–0.30) and overall survival (HR = 0.58; 0.46–0.73) compared with control treatment. BCR pathway inhibitors increased the probability of response (RR = 3.54; 95{\%} CI: 1.69–7.41) and decreased the risk of progression (RR = 0.21, 95{\%} CI: 0.13–0.34). However, BCR pathway inhibitors increased the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs; RR = 1.25; 95{\%} CI: 1.08–1.44) and serious AEs (RR = 1.32; 95{\%} CI: 1.17–1.50). AEs causing discontinuation (RR = 1.26; 95{\%} CI: 0.88–1.81) or death (RR = 1.06; 95{\%} CI: 0.72–1.57) were not significantly increased. No statistically significant difference in any aspect of meta-analysis was noted between ibrutinib and idelalisib.},

abstract = {Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were hypothesized to be robust and easily measured biomarkers of radiation exposure, which has led to multiple studies in various clinical and experimental scenarios. We sought to identify evolutionary conserved, radiation-induced circulating miRNAs through a multispecies, integrative systematic review and meta-analysis of miRNAs in radiation. Methods and Materials: The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (ID: 81701). We downloaded a list of studies with the query: (circulating OR plasma OR serum) AND (miRNA or microRNA) AND (radiat* OR radiotherapy OR irradiati*) from MEDLINE (103 studies), EMBASE (364 studies), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (0 studies). After deleting 116 duplicates, the remaining 351 abstracts were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were experimental study; human, mice, rat or nonhuman primate study; and serum or plasma miRNA expression measured before and after radiation exposure. Results: The screening procedure yielded 62 research studies. After verification, 30 articles contained data on miRNA expression change after irradiation. Thus, we obtained a database of 131 miRNAs from 96 pairwise post-/preirradiation comparisons reporting 2508 fold changes (FCs) of circulating miRNAs. The meta-analysis showed 28 miRNAs with significant radiation-induced change of their expression in the serum. In metaregression analysis, 7 miRNAs—miR-150 (FC = 0.40; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.45), miR-29a (FC = 0.87; 95{\%} CI, 0.79-0.96), miR-29b (FC = 0.85; 95{\%} CI, 0.76-0.96), miR-30c (FC = 1.19; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.30), miR-200b (FC = 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-1.48), miR-320a (FC = 1.13; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.23), and miR-30a (FC = 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.30)—significantly correlated with either total or fraction dose of radiation. Additionally, miR-150, miR-320a, miR-200b, and miR-30c correlated significantly with time elapsed since irradiation. Conclusions: Circulating miRNAs reflect the impact of ionizing radiation irrespective of the studied species, often in a dose-dependent manner. This makes circulating miRNAs promising biomarkers of radiation exposure.},

abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to assess parameters of retinal morphology by using high-definition optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with Wolfram syndrome (WFS) and their relation to optic tract atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Method: High-definition OCT and MRI parameters were evaluated in 12 patients with WFS (three males, nine females; median age at examination 12y 8mo, range 10y 2mo–15y 11mo) and referred to 30 individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (12 males, 18 females; median age at examination 20y 5mo, range 16y 8mo–21y 4mo) and 33 typically developing comparison participants (10 males, 23 females; median age at examination 20y 7mo, range 13y–22y 4mo). Results: Total thickness and quadrant thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), macular full-thickness parameters and macular ganglion cell layer/inner plexiform layer, intraorbital and intracranial thickness of the optical nerve, as well as the optic chiasm and visual tracts were significantly reduced in patients with WFS compared with those having T1D and the typically developing comparison participants. Optic chiasm thickness correlated negatively in patients with WFS with both age (r=−0.79; p=0.002) and duration of diabetes (r=−0.62; p=0.032). Thickness of the intraorbital parts of the optic nerves in patients with WFS correlated positively with thickness of the superior RNFL (r=0.73; p=0.006). Interpretation: High-definition OCT in combination with MRI could become an important tool for evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic trials in patients with WFS. What this paper adds: Provides evidence of significant reduction of retinal parameters and optic nerves in patients with Wolfram syndrome (WFS). Shows correlations between magnetic resonance imaging parameters and retinal morphology parameters in patients with WFS.},

abstract = {Objective: One of the therapeutic options for patients with tuberous sclerosis (TCS) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is everolimus treatment once daily, every day, to attain trough concentrations of 5–15 ng/ml (standard treatment). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a reduced dose of everolimus (three times a week with a daily dose as in standard treatment—maintenance therapy) in a group of patients who were previously treated with standard dose for at least 12 months. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (six males, four females; median age 14.23 years) with TSC-related SEGA who met inclusion criteria were included into a single-arm, prospective trial. All the patients were followed over at least 12 months (median 12 and range 12–24 months). Tumor volumes from day 0, 90, 180, and 360 were evaluated by an experienced radiologist and an objective computer-based method and compared. Adverse events (AEs) noted during maintenance therapy were compared to the AEs observed during standard everolimus therapy. Results: The differences in SEGA volume between subsequent time points (day 0, 90, 120, and 360) were not statistically significant. No clinical symptoms of tumor regrowth were observed. AEs were significantly less severe and less frequent during maintenance compared with standard therapy. Conclusions: Maintenance therapy with reduced-dose everolimus is an effective therapeutic option for patients with TSC and SEGA after the completion of standard therapy and may moderate the rates of adverse effects.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the reliability of the standard planimetric methodology of volumetric analysis and three different open-source semi-automated approaches of brain tumor segmentation. Materials and methods: The volumes of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) examined by 30 MRI studies of 10 patients from a previous everolimus-related trial (EMINENTS study) were estimated using four methods: planimetric method (modified MacDonald ellipsoid method), ITK-Snap (pixel clustering, geodesic active contours, region competition methods), 3D Slicer (level-set thresholding), and NIRFast (k-means clustering, Markov random fields). The methods were compared, and a trial simulation was performed to determine how the choice of approach could influence the final decision about progression or response. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient was high (0.95; 95{\%} CI 0.91–0.98). The planimetric method always overestimated the size of the tumor, while virtually no mean difference was found between ITK-Snap and 3D Slicer (P = 0.99). NIRFast underestimated the volume and presented a proportional bias. During the trial simulation, a moderate level of agreement between all the methods (kappa 0.57–0.71, P {\textless} 0.002) was noted. Conclusion: Semi-automated segmentation can ease oncological follow-up but the moderate level of agreement between segmentation methods suggests that the reference standard volumetric method for SEGA tumors should be revised and chosen carefully, as the selection of volumetry tool may influence the conclusion about tumor progression or response.},

It is therefore necessary to incorporate refined risk estimation tools which can be applied at the individual subject level. The aim of the study was to develop an easy-to use, short refined risk estimation tool to predict the development of psychosis in a new CHR-P cohort recruited in European country with less established early detection services. Methods: A cohort of 105 CHR-P individuals was assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States12/2006, and then followed for a median period of 36 months (25th-75th percentile:10–59 months) for transition to psychosis. A multivariate Cox regression model predicting transition was generated with preselected clinical predictors and was internally validated with 1000 bootstrap resamples. Results: Speech disorganization and unusual thought content were selected as potential predictors of conversion on the basis of published literature. The prediction model was significant (p {\textless} 0.0001) and confirmed that both speech disorganization (HR = 1.69; 95{\%}CI: 1.39–2.05) and unusual thought content (HR = 1.51; 95{\%}CI: 1.27–1.80) were significantly associated with transition. The prognostic accuracy of the model was adequate (Harrell's c- index = 0.79), even after optimism correction through internal validation procedures (Harrell's c-index = 0.78). Conclusions: The clinical prediction model developed, and internally validated, herein to predict transition from a CHR-P to psychosis may be a promising tool for use in clinical settings.

Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, hospitalised at the Department of General and Colorectal Surgery of the Medical University in L{\'{o}}d during the period from January 2015 to April 2015, were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their families' medical case record, factors predisposing them to the development of colorectal cancer, the tests applied in diagnostics, and the treatment process. The questionnaire comprised 42 closed-ended questions with one correct answer. A statistical analysis of all answers was carried out. Results. The study group consisted of 30 men and 20 women aged 27-94 years old. A strong, statistically significant negative correlation between a patient's age and his/her awareness of the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer was noted (p{\textless}0.001; r= -0.51).

abstract = {Brief Description: The results demonstrate that the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scale provides the best recurrence and progression prediction in comparison with European Association of Urology (EAU) and Club Urologico Espanol de Tratamiento Oncologico (CUETO) risk scores among a mixed population of patients with non–muscle-invasive bladder who were treated with, or without, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and without any immediate postoperative chemotherapy. The study highlights the role of tumor diameter and extent in transition prediction. This retrospective cohort analysis of 322 patients with newly diagnosed non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) assesses the concordance and accuracy of predicting recurrence and progression by EAU-recommended tools (EAU risk groups, EORTC, and CUETO). One-year and five-year c-indices ranged from 0.55 to 0.66 for recurrence and from 0.72 to 0.82 for progression. AUCROC of predictions ranged from 0.46 for 1-year recurrence risk based on CUETO groups, to 0.82 for 1-year progression risk based on EAU risk groups. Diameter (HR: 1.91; 95{\%} CI: 1.39-2.61) and tumor extent (HR: 1.21; 95{\%} CI: 1.01-1.46 for recurrence; HR: 3.1; 95{\%} CI: 1.40-6.87 for progression) were shown to be significant predictors in multistate analysis. Lower accuracy of prediction was observed for patients treated with BCG maintenance immunotherapy. The EORTC model (overall c-index c = 0.64; 95{\%} CI: 0.61-0.68) was superior to the EAU (P =.035;.62; 95{\%} CI: 0.59-0.66) and CUETO (P {\textless}.001; c = 0.53; 95{\%} CI: 0.50-0.56) models in predicting recurrence. The EORTC model (c = 0.82; 95{\%} CI: 0.77-0.86) also performed better than CUETO (P =.008; c = 0.73; 95{\%} CI: 0.66-0.81) but there was no sufficient evidence that it performed better than EAU (P =.572; c = 0.81; 95{\%} CI: 0.77-0.84) for predicting progression. EORTC and CUETO gave similar predictions for progression in BCG-treated EAU high-risk patients (P =.48). We share anonymized individual patient data. In conclusion, despite moderate accuracy, EORTC provided the best recurrence and progression prediction for a mixed population of patients treated with, or without BCG, and without immediate postoperative chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for locoregional staging of rectal cancer and offers promise for the prediction of hematologic toxicity. The present study compares the clinical utility of MRI-based active bone marrow (BMact) delineation with that of CT-based bone marrow total (BMtot) delineation for predicting hematologic toxicity. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed. Eligible patients had stage II/III rectal cancer and qualified for preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The BMact areas on T1-weighted MRI were contoured. The impact of the dose–volume parameters of BMact/BMtot and clinical data on hematologic toxicity were assessed. Basic endpoints were the occurrence of grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity and peripheral blood parameters reaching a nadir. Linear regression models were generated for the nadirs and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the occurrence of grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity. Results: Thirty-five patients were enrolled. Women presented higher dose–volume parameters of BMact, BMtot, and lymphocyte nadir (ALCnadir{\%}) than men. Models for the prediction of ALCnadir{\%} (V5-V20BMtot, V5-V30BMact) and platelet nadir (PLTnadir{\%}; V5-V10BMtot, V5-V20BMact) were statistically significant. In the ROC curves, a baseline lymphocyte level of 1.81 × 103/ml was adopted as the cutoff for predicting grade 3/4 lymphopenia, with specificity of 77.8{\%} and sensitivity of 73.1{\%}. The multivariate linear regression model for ALCnadir{\%} had R2 = 0.53, p = 0.038. In the tenth step of selection, V5BMact (p = 0.002) and gender (p = 0.019) remained. The multivariate linear regression model for PLTnadir{\%} had R2 = 0.20, p = 0.34. In the sixth step of selection, V15BMact remained (p = 0.026). Conclusion: The dose–volume parameters of BMact serve as better predictors of ALCnadir{\%} and PLTnadir{\%} than BMtot.},

The software is gathering details about patients' diet and associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals, specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).},

DATA SOURCES KEYNOTE-045, IMvigor211, CheckMate275, Javelin Solid Tumor, MEDI4736, and KEYNOTE-0528 clinical trials. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY There are ongoing clinical trials using combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy as first line of therapy in the setting of metastatic urothelial cancer and also to determine the duration of treatment. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Immunotherapy is approved as a second-line treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer. Their use as a first-line agent is only limited to patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-based treatments. Five drugs are approved by Food and Drug Administration for metastatic urothelial cancer including 3 Programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors and 2 programmed cell-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in patients who have progressed during or after platinum-based therapy. Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab are PD-1 inhibitors. Durvalumab and avelumab are PD-L1 inhibitors. However, only 2 drugs were approved based on phase III clinical trials-pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, of which only KEYNOTE study performed with pembrolizumab showed overall survival difference. Atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are the Food and Drug Administration-approved checkpoint inhibitors in cisplatin-ineligible patients. CONCLUSION This review article summarizes the significance of immunotherapy in treatment of bladder cancer, its side effects, and limitations.},

abstract = {Our expanding knowledge of immunotherapy for solid tumors has led to an explosion of clinical trials aimed at urothelial carcinoma. The primary strategy is centered on unleashing the immune system by releasing the inhibitory signals propagated by programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Many antibody constructs have been developed to block these interactions and are used in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies including ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab and pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1 antibodies including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab. One of the latest inhibitors is durvalumab, which is a high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80. Currently, there are a number of ongoing trials in advanced urothelial carcinoma both using durvalumab monotherapy and in combination with other targeted therapies. In addition, durvalumab is being investigated in the non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, which is centered around intravenous formulations. These exciting developments have added a significant number of therapies in a previously limited treatment landscape.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and the role of PD-L1 expression on clinical response in patients with advanced urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Methods: A phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label study is being conducted in patients with inoperable or metastatic solid tumors. We report here the results from the UBC expansion cohort. Durvalumab (MEDI4736, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered intravenously for up to 12 months. The primary end point was safety, and objective response rate (ORR, confirmed) was a key secondary end point. An exploratory analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsies led to defining PD-L1-positive as ≥ 25{\%} of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells expressing membrane PD-L1. Results: A total of 61 patients (40 PD-L1-positive, 21 PD-L1-negative), 93.4{\%} of whom received one or more prior therapies for advanced disease, were treated (median duration of follow-up, 4.3 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were fatigue (13.1{\%}), diarrhea (9.8{\%}), and decreased appetite (8.2{\%}). Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in three patients (4.9{\%}); there were no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs. One treatment-related AE (acute kidney injury) resulted in treatment discontinuation. The ORR was 31.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 17.6 to 47.1) in 42 response-evaluable patients, 46.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 27.5 to 66.1) in the PD-L1-positive subgroup, and 0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.0 to 23.2) in the PD-L1-negative subgroup. Responses are ongoing in 12 of 13 responding patients, with median duration of response not yet reached (range, 4.1+ to 49.3+ weeks). Conclusion: Durvalumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and evidence of meaningful clinical activity in PD-L1-positive patients with UBC, many of whom were heavily pretreated.},

abstract = {The objectives of these investigations were: (a) to make a preliminary study to assess concentration-depth profiles of mitomycin C (MMC) in the bladder wall at specified time intervals after passive diffusion (PD); and (b) to conduct a major study to compare concentration-depth profiles after PD and electromotive drug administration (EMDA) of MMC. Full thickness sections of viable human bladder wall were placed in two-chamber cells with urothelium exposed to donor compartments containing 40 mg of MMC in 100 ml of 0.96{\%} NaCl solutions and with serosa-facing receptor compartments containing 0.9{\%} NaCl solutions. In the preliminary study during each of nine experimental sessions, five sections of bladder wall were individually exposed to MMC for either 5,15, 30, 45, or 60 min. In the major study, an anode and a cathode were sited in the donor and receptor compartments, and 14 paired experiments - current (20 mA)/no current - were conducted over a 30-min period. Bladder wall sections were cut serially into 40-$\mu$m slices parallel to the urothelium and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for MMC concentration ($\mu$g/g wet tissue weight). Tissue viability and morphology and MMC stability were assessed by trypan-blue exclusion test, histological examination, and mass spectrometry analysis. In the preliminary study (PD only), mean MMC concentrations ($\mu$g) at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min were: (a) for urothelium, 15.3, 60.0, 58.2, 60.1, and 57.8, respectively; (b) for lamina propria, 2.2, 18.9, 19.3, 16.1, and 17.3, respectively; and (c) for muscularis, 0.4, 2.0, 1.8, 1.3, and 2.4, respectively. In the comparative study, MMC concentrations and coefficients of variation (CV) were as follows: (a) for urothelium after PD, 46.6 with CV = 69{\%}, and after EMDA, 170.0 with CV = 43{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001); (b) for lamina propria after PD, 16.1, with CV = 60{\%}, and after EMDA, 65.6 with CV = 29{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001); and (c) for muscularis after PD, 1.9 with CV = 82{\%}, and after EMDA, 15.9 with CV = 82{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0005). All of the bladder sections remained viable, and the chemical structure of MMC was unchanged. It was concluded that EMDA significantly enhances MMC transport into all of the layers of the bladder wall, and sections of viable human bladder are a reliable tool for assessing different modes of drug delivery.},

abstract = {Background: Bladder cancer (BC) has become a major worldwide public health issue, especially non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). A flood of related clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have emerged; however, the quality and recommendations of the guidelines are controversial. We aimed to appraise the quality of the CPGs for NMIBC within the past 5 years and compare the similarities and differences between recommendations for therapies. Methods: A systematic search to identify CPGs for NMIBC was performed using electronic databases (including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science), guideline development organizations, and professional societies from January 12, 2014 to January 12, 2019. The Appraisal of Guidelines Research {\&} Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument was used to evaluate the quality of the guidelines. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis was performed to assess the overall agreement among reviewers. Results: Nine CPGs were included. The overall agreement among reviewers was excellent. The interquartile range (IQR) of scores for each domain were as follows: scope and purpose 69.44{\%} (35.42, 85.42{\%}); stakeholder involvement 41.67{\%} (30.56, 75.00{\%}); rigour of development 48.96{\%} (27.08, 65.63{\%}); clarity and presentation 80.56{\%} (75.00, 86.11{\%}); applicability 34.38{\%} (22.92, 40.63{\%}) and editorial independence 70.83{\%} (35.42, 85.42{\%}). The NICE, AUA, EAU and CRHA/CPAM clinical practice guidelines consistently scored well in most domains. It was generally accepted that the transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and intravesical chemotherapy should be performed in the management of bladder cancer. The application of chemotherapy was highly controversial in high risk NMIBC. The courses of BCG maintenance were similar and included 3 years of therapy at full maintenance doses. Conclusions: The quality of NMIBC guidelines within the past 5 years varied, especially regarding stakeholders, rigour and applicability. Despite many similarities, the recommendations had some inconsistencies in the details.},

OBJECTIVE: To report a planned update of the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in patients with locally advanced/metastatic UC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is an ongoing phase 1/2 open-label study of 191 adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced/metastatic UC whose disease had progressed on, were ineligible for, or refused prior chemotherapy from 60 sites in 9 countries as reported herein. INTERVENTION: Patients were administered durvalumab intravenous infusion, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, for up to 12 months or until progression, starting another anticancer therapy, or unacceptable toxic effects. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were safety and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) per blinded independent central review (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1). RESULTS: A total of 191 patients with UC had received treatment. As of October 24, 2016 (90-day update), the median follow-up was 5.78 months (range, 0.4-25.9 months). The median age of patients was 67.0 years and most were male (136 [71.2{\%}]) and white (123 [71.1{\%}]). All patients had stage 4 disease, and 190 (99.5{\%}) had prior anticancer therapy (182 [95.3{\%}] postplatinum). The ORR was 17.8{\%} (34 of 191; 95{\%} CI, 12.7{\%}-24.0{\%}), including 7 complete responses. Responses were early (median time to response, 1.41 months), durable (median duration of response not reached), and observed regardless of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression (ORR, 27.6{\%} [n = 27; 95{\%} CI, 19.0{\%}-37.5{\%}] and 5.1{\%} [n = 4; 95{\%} CI, 1.4{\%}-12.5{\%}] in patients with high and low or negative expression of PD-L1, respectively). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.5 months (95{\%} CI, 1.4-1.9 months) and 18.2 months (95{\%} CI, 8.1 months to not estimable), respectively; the 1-year overall survival rate was 55{\%} (95{\%} CI, 44{\%}-65{\%}), as estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 13 patients (6.8{\%}); grade 3/4 immune-mediated AEs occurred in 4 patients (2.1{\%}); and treatment-related AEs led to discontinuation of 3 patients (1.6{\%}), 2 of whom had immune-mediated AEs that led to death (autoimmune hepatitis and pneumonitis). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Durvalumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, demonstrates favorable clinical activity and an encouraging and manageable safety profile in patients with locally advanced/metastatic UC.

abstract = {Background Patients with non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) belonging to the intermediate-risk group should be treated with intravesical instillations to prevent recurrence and progression. Objective We compared the outcome of a monthly maintenance bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) regimen with that of epirubicin (EPI) and interferon-$\alpha$2a (IFN) in patients with NMIBC. Design, setting, and participants Our prospective randomized multicenter study comprised 229 eligible patients with frequently recurrent TaT1 grade 1–2 or low-grade NMIBC enrolled between 1997 and 2008. Interventions The four-arm study involved a single perioperative instillation of EPI plus five weekly instillations of BCG or EPI/IFN, followed by 11 monthly instillations in the 1-yr BCG or EPI/IFN maintenance arms, further followed by four additional quarterly instillations in the two 2-yr maintenance arms. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Time to recurrence, progression, disease-specific survival, and overall mortality were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence analyses plus the Cox and proportional subdistribution hazards models. Results and limitations The median follow-up time was 7.5 and 7.4 yr in the BCG and EPI/IFN groups, respectively. The probability of recurrence was significantly lower in the BCG group than in the EPI/IFN group. The probability was 39{\%} versus 72{\%} at 7.4 yr, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.41; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.28–0.60; p {\textless} 0.001). There was no significant difference in the probability of progression or in overall survival. However, there was a significant difference in disease-specific mortality in favor of the BCG group (HR: 0.20; 95{\%} CI, 0.04–0.91; p = 0.04). Conclusions The monthly maintenance BCG regimen showed excellent efficacy and was significantly better in preventing recurrence than a similar regimen of EPI/IFN-$\alpha$2a. Patient summary A monthly bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) regimen showed excellent efficacy and was significantly better in preventing recurrence than a similar regimen of epirubicin and interferon-$\alpha$2a.

abstract = {Context The European Association of Urology non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) guidelines recommend that all low- and intermediate-risk patients receive a single immediate instillation of chemotherapy after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), but its use remains controversial. Objective To identify which NMIBC patients benefit from a single immediate instillation. Evidence acquisition A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the efficacy of a single instillation after TURB with TURB alone in NMIBC patients was carried out. Evidence synthesis A total of 13 eligible studies were identified. IPD were obtained for 11 studies randomizing 2278 eligible patients, 1161 to TURB and 1117 to a single instillation of epirubicin, mitomycin C, pirarubicin, or thiotepa. A total of 1128 recurrences, 108 progressions, and 460 deaths (59 due to bladder cancer [BCa]) occurred. A single instillation reduced the risk of recurrence by 35{\%} (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.74; p {\textless} 0.001) and the 5-yr recurrence rate from 58.8{\%} to 44.8{\%}. The instillation did not reduce recurrences in patients with a prior recurrence rate of more than one recurrence per year or in patients with an European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence score ≥5. The instillation did not prolong either the time to progression or death from BCa, but it resulted in an increase in the overall risk of death (HR: 1.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.51; p = 0.015; 5-yr death rates 12.0{\%} vs 11.2{\%}), with the difference appearing in patients with an EORTC recurrence score ≥5. Conclusions A single immediate instillation reduced the risk of recurrence, except in patients with a prior recurrence rate of more than one recurrence per year or an EORTC recurrence score ≥5. It does not prolong either time to progression or death from BCa. The instillation may be associated with an increase in the risk of death in patients at high risk of recurrence in whom the instillation is not effective or recommended. Patient summary A single instillation of chemotherapy immediately after resection reduces the risk of recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; however, it should not be given to patients at high risk of recurrence due to its lack of efficacy in this subgroup.},

A meta-Analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of adding chemotherapy to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in intermediate-And high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of combination therapy and BCG monotherapy for intermediate-And highriskNMIBCwere comprehensively searched.Relevant databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials databases, and American Society of Clinical Oncology (http://www.asco. org/ASCO), the clinical trial registration website (ClinicalTrials.gov), and relevant trials from the references of selected studies were searched from initial state up to June 6, 2015. Random-effects model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) statistics. All statistical analyses were performed by STATA (version 13.0, College Station, TX). Seven studies, including 1373 patients with intermediate-And highrisk NMIBC, were identified. For disease-free survival, the pooled HRs from all studies was 0.69 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.00; P=0.048). The disease-free survival benefit was more apparent among patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC (P=0.002) or Ta/T1 with/without carcinoma in situ (P{\textless}0.01).

abstract = {Background: Despite local therapies, commonly transurethral resection (TUR) followed by adjuvant treatments, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a high rate of recurrence and progression. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) has been shown to reduce recurrence and progression in people with NMIBC following TUR, however many people do not respond to treatment, have recurrence shortly after, or cannot tolerate standard-dose therapy. The potential for synergistic antitumour activity of interferon (IFN)-alpha ($\alpha$) and BCG provides some rationale for combination therapy for people who do not tolerate or respond to standard-dose BCG therapy. Objectives: To assess the effects of intravesically administered BCG plus IFN-$\alpha$ compared with BCG alone for treating non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2016), Embase (OvidSP) (1974 to 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) as well as reference lists of retrieved articles and handsearched abstract proceedings of relevant conferences for the past three years. We applied no language restrictions. The date of last search of all databases was 25 August 2016. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pseudo-randomised trials assessing intravesically administered BCG plus IFN-$\alpha$ versus BCG alone in adults of either gender with histologically confirmed Ta and T1 superficial bladder cancer, with or without carcinoma in situ, treated with TUR. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We used Review Manager 5 for data synthesis and employed the random-effects model for meta-analyses. For prespecified outcomes, where we were unable to derive time-to-event information (e.g. time-to-recurrence), we assessed dichotomous outcomes (e.g. recurrence) instead. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included five RCTs involving a total of 1231 participants with NMIBC in this review. Due to poor reporting, the risk of bias in the included studies was often unclear. We assessed the studies under two main comparisons: intravesical BCG plus IFN-$\alpha$ versus intravesical BCG alone (four RCTs), and intravesical BCG alternating with IFN-$\alpha$ versus intravesical BCG alone (one RCT). Intravesical BCG plus IFN-$\alpha$ versus intravesical BCG alone (four RCTs): We observed no clear difference between BCG plus IFN-$\alpha$ and BCG alone for recurrence (average risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.32; 4 RCTs; 925 participants; very low-quality evidence) or progression (average RR 0.26, 95{\%} CI 0.04 to 1.87; 2 RCTs; 219 participants; low-quality evidence). The included RCTs did not report on the other primary outcome of this review, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events. Regarding secondary outcomes, we observed no clear difference for disease-specific mortality (RR 0.38, 95{\%} CI 0.05 to 3.05; 1 RCT; 99 participants; very low-quality evidence). Two RCTs reporting contradictory findings for adverse events could not be pooled due to variation in definitions. There were no data from the included RCTs on time-to-death or disease-specific quality of life. Intravesical BCG alternating with IFN-$\alpha$ versus intravesical BCG alone (one RCT): We observed shorter time-to-recurrence for participants in the BCG alternating with IFN-$\alpha$ group compared with the BCG alone group (hazard ratio (HR) 2.86, 95{\%} CI 1.98 to 4.13; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence), but no clear differences in time-to-progression (HR 2.39, 95{\%} CI 0.92 to 6.21; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence) and discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events (RR 2.97, 95{\%} CI 0.31 to 28.09; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence). Regarding secondary outcomes, there were no clear differences between the BCG alternating with IFN-$\alpha$ and BCG alone groups for disease-specific mortality (HR 2.74, 95{\%} CI 0.73 to 10.28; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence), time-to-death (overall survival) (HR 1.00, 95{\%} CI 0.68 to 1.47; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence), or systemic or local adverse events (RR 1.65, 95{\%} CI 0.41 to 6.73; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence). There were no data on disease-specific quality of life. Authors' conclusions: We found low- to very low-quality evidence suggesting no clear differences in recurrence or progression with BCG plus IFN-$\alpha$ compared with BCG alone for people with NMIBC; there was no information to determine the effect on discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events. Low-quality evidence suggests BCG alternating with IFN-$\alpha$ compared with BCG alone may increase time-to-recurrence, however low-quality evidence also suggests no clear differences for time-to-progression or discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events. Additional high-quality, adequately powered trials using standardised instillation regimens and doses of both BCG and IFN-$\alpha$, reporting outcomes in subgroups stratified by patient and tumour characteristics, and on long-term outcomes related not only to recurrence but also to progression, discontinuation due to adverse events, and mortality may help to clarify the ideal treatment strategy and provide a more definitive result.},

abstract = {Background: Electromotive drug administration (EMDA) is the use of electrical current to improve the delivery of intravesical agents to reduce the risk of recurrence in people with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). It is unclear how effective this is in comparison to other forms of intravesical therapy. Objectives: To assess the effects of intravesical EMDA for the treatment of NMIBC. Search methods: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE), two clinical trial registries and a grey literature repository. We searched reference lists of relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. The last search was February 2017. Selection criteria: We searched for randomised studies comparing EMDA of any intravesical agent used to reduce bladder cancer recurrence in conjunction with transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to GRADE on a per outcome basis. Main results: We included three trials with 672 participants that described five distinct comparisons. The same principal investigator conducted all three trials. All studies used mitomycin C (MMC) as the chemotherapeutic agent for EMDA. 1. Postoperative MMC-EMDA induction versus postoperative Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) induction: based on one study with 72 participants with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and concurrent pT1 urothelial carcinoma, we are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.76; corresponding to 30 more per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 180 fewer to 380 more). There was no disease progression in either treatment arm at three months' follow-up. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.18 to 3.11). 2. Postoperative MMC-EMDA induction versus MMC-passive diffusion (PD) induction: based on one study with 72 participants with CIS and concurrent pT1 urothelial carcinoma, postoperative MMC-EMDA may (low QoE) reduce disease recurrence (RR 0.65, 95{\%} CI 0.44 to 0.98; corresponding to 147 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 235 fewer to 8 fewer). There was no disease progression in either treatment arm at three months' follow-up. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on serious adverse events (RR 1.50, 95{\%} CI 0.27 to 8.45). 3. Postoperative MMC-EMDA with sequential BCG induction and maintenance versus postoperative BCG induction and maintenance: based on one study with 212 participants with pT1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with or without CIS, postoperative MMC-EMDA with sequential BCG may result (low QoE) in a longer time to recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95{\%} CI 0.34 to 0.77; corresponding to 181 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 256 fewer to 79 fewer) and time to progression (HR 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.17 to 0.75; corresponding to 63 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 82 fewer to 24 fewer). We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95{\%} CI 0.21 to 4.94). 4. Single-dose, preoperative MMC-EMDA versus single-dose, postoperative MMC-PD: based on one study with 236 participants with primary pTa and pT1 urothelial carcinoma, preoperative MMC-EMDA likely (moderate QoE) results in a longer time to recurrence (HR 0.47, 95{\%} CI 0.32 to 0.69; corresponding to 247 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 341 fewer to 130 fewer) for a median follow-up of 86 months. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to progression (HR 0.81, 95{\%} CI 0.00 to 259.93; corresponding to 34 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 193 fewer to 807 more) and serious adverse events (RR 0.79, 95{\%} CI 0.30 to 2.05). 5. Single-dose, preoperative MMC-EMDA versus TURBT alone: based on one study with 233 participants with primary pTa and pT1 urothelial carcinoma, preoperative MMC-EMDA likely (moderate QoE) results in a longer time to recurrence (HR 0.40, 95{\%} CI 0.28 to 0.57; corresponding to 304 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 390 fewer to 198 fewer) for a median follow-up of 86 months. We are uncertain (very low QoE) about the effect of MMC-EMDA on time to progression (HR 0.74, 95{\%} CI 0.00 to 247.93; corresponding to 49 fewer per 1000 participants, 95{\%} CI 207 fewer to 793 more) or serious adverse events (HR 1.74, 95{\%} CI 0.52 to 5.77). Authors' conclusions: While the use of EMDA to administer intravesical MMC may result in a delay in time to recurrence in select patient populations, we are uncertain about its impact on serious adverse events in all settings. Common reasons for downgrading the QoE were study limitations and imprecision. A potential role for EMDA-based administration of MMC may lie in settings where more established agents (such as BCG) are not available. In the setting of low or very low QoE for most comparisons, our confidence in the effect estimates is limited and the true effect sizes may be substantially different from those reported here.},

abstract = {Background: The rationale for combining anticancer drugs has not been applied consistently to use of intravesical agents for treatment of superficial bladder cancer, for which immunotherapeutic BCG and chemotherapeutic mitomycin seem to be a potentially effective combination. We aimed to do a prospective, randomised comparison of BCG alone with that of sequential BCG and electromotive mitomycin in patients with stage pT1 bladder cancer. Methods: After transurethral resection and multiple biopsies, 212 patients with stage pT1 bladder cancer were randomly assigned to: 81 mg BCG infused over 120 min once a week for 6 weeks (n=105); or to 81 mg BCG infused over 120 min once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 40 mg electromotive mitomycin (intravesical electric current 20 mA for 30 min) once a week as one cycle for three cycles (n=107). Complete responders underwent maintenance treatment: those assigned BCG alone had one infusion of 81 mg BCG once a month for 10 months, and those assigned BCG and mitomycin had 40 mg electromotive mitomycin once a month for 2 months, followed by 81 mg BCG once a month as one cycle for three cycles. The primary endpoint was disease-free interval; secondary endpoints were time to progression; overall survival; and disease-specific survival. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial has been submitted for registration at the US National Cancer Institute website http://clinicaltrials.gov. Findings: Median follow-up was 88 months (IQR 63-110). Patients assigned sequential BCG and electromotive mitomycin had higher disease-free interval than did those assigned BCG alone (69 months [95{\%} CI 55-86] vs 21 months [15-54]; difference between groups 48 months [42-54], log-rank p=0.0012). Patients assigned sequential BCG and electromotive mitomycin also had lower recurrence (41.9{\%} [32.7-51.5] vs 57.9{\%} [48.7-67.5]; difference between groups 16.0{\%} [2.7-29.3], log-rank p=0.0012); progression (9.3{\%} [3.8-14.8] vs 21.9{\%} [17.9-25.9]; difference between groups 12.6{\%} [3.0-22.2], log-rank p=0.004); overall mortality (21.5{\%} [13.5-29.5] vs 32.4{\%} [23.4-41.4], difference between groups 10.9{\%} [0.6-21.2], log-rank p=0.045); and disease-specific mortality (5.6{\%} [1.2-10.0] vs 16.2{\%} [6.1-23.3], difference between groups 10.6{\%} [2.5-18.7], log-rank p=0.01). Side-effects were mainly localised to the bladder. Interpretation: BCG-induced inflammation might increase the permeability of the bladder mucosa such that mitomycin can reach the target tissue more easily and exert its anticancer effect.},

@article{Perlis2013,
abstract = {Context Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) commonly recurs, requiring invasive and costly transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). A meta-analysis of seven trials published in 2004 demonstrated that intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) following TURBT reduces recurrences. Despite European Association of Urology endorsement, adoption of this practice has been modest. Objective To investigate whether immediate postoperative IVC prolongs the recurrence-free interval (RFI) and early recurrences (ERs) in light of new trial data and to explore the quality of evidence supporting its use. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature review of random controlled trials (RCTs) published before March 2013 was performed using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Trials examining NMIBC recurrence for adults receiving IVC immediately following TURBT were included. RFI was estimated by hazard ratio (HR), and ER was estimated by absolute risk reduction (ARR) of recurrences within 1 yr of TURBT. Both outcomes were synthesized using random-effects models. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool, and quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Evidence synthesis Thirteen studies with 2548 patients were included. IVC prolonged RFI by 38{\%} (HR: 0.62; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.77; p {\textless} 0.001; I 2: 69{\%}), and ERs were 12{\%} less likely in the intervention population (ARR: 0.12; 95{\%} CI, -0.18 to -0.06; p {\textless} 0.001, I2: 0{\%}). The number needed to treat to prevent one ER was 9 (95{\%} CI, 6-17 patients). There was high risk of bias present in 12 of 13 publications. Quality of evidence for RFI was very low and low for ERs. Conclusions Our updated meta-analysis supports that IVC prolongs RFI and reduces ERs of NMIBC when administered immediately after TURBT. However, contemporary methodology suggests low evidence quality for examined outcomes. Thus RCTs with careful randomization and blinding are still warranted to clarify the usefulness of immediate postoperative IVC in this population. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Purpose: We determined if 1 immediate instillation of chemotherapy after transurethral resection (TUR) decreases the risk of recurrence in patients with stage Ta T1 single and multiple bladder cancer overall and separately. Materials and Methods: A meta-analysis was performed of the published results of randomized clinical trials comparing TUR alone to TUR plus 1 immediate instillation of chemotherapy. Results: Our study included 7 randomized trials with recurrence information on 1,476 patients. Based on a median followup of 3. 4 years and a maximum of 14.5 years, 267 of 728 patients (36.7{\%}) receiving 1 postoperative instillation of epirubicin, mitomycin C, thiotepa or (2″R)-4′-O-ntetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicin (pirarubicin) had recurrence compared to 362 of 748 patients (48.4{\%}) with TUR alone, a decrease of 39{\%} in the odds of recurrence with chemotherapy (OR 0.61, p {\textless} 0.0001). Patients with a single tumor (OR 0.61) and those with multiple tumors (OR 0.44) benefited. However, after 1 instillation 65.2{\%} of patients with multiple tumors had recurrence compared to 35.8{\%} of patients with single tumors, showing that 1 instillation alone is insufficient treatment for patients with multiple tumors. Conclusions: One immediate intravesical instillation of chemotherapy significantly decreases the risk of recurrence after TUR in patients with stage Ta T1 single and multiple bladder cancer. It is the treatment of choice in patients with a single, low risk papillary tumor and is recommended as the initial treatment after TUR in patients with higher risk tumors.},

abstract = {Cancer is a devastating disease that takes the lives of hundreds of thousands of people every year. Due to disease heterogeneity, standard treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation, are effective in only a subset of the patient population. Tumors can have different underlying genetic causes and may express different proteins in one patient versus another. This inherent variability of cancer lends itself to the growing field of precision and personalized medicine (PPM). There are many ongoing efforts to acquire PPM data in order to characterize molecular differences between tumors. Some PPM products are already available to link these differences to an effective drug. It is clear that PPM cancer treatments can result in immense patient benefits, and companies and regulatory agencies have begun to recognize this. However, broader changes to the healthcare and insurance systems must be addressed if PPM is to become part of standard cancer care.},

Although unique features exist at the undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education levels, shared aspects of all three levels are especially revealing, and form the basis for informed decision-making about the future of medical education.This paper describes some of the internal and external challenges confronting undergraduate medical education. Key internal challenges include the focus on disease to the relative exclusion of behavior, inpatient versus outpatient education, and implications of a faculty whose research is highly focused at the molecular or submolecular level. External factors include the exponential growth in knowledge, associated technologic ("disruptive") innovations, and societal changes. Addressing these challenges requires decisive institutional leadership with an eye to 2020 and beyond--the period in which current matriculants will begin their careers.

abstract = {Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the stage pT1nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a high probability of recurrence after initial diagnosis and treatment. However, risk factors predictive of repeated recurrence and progression of pT1 bladder tumors after primary relapse have not been uncovered. Thus, we conducted the retrospective study. A total of 418 patients who suffered initial recurrence after transurethral resection (TUR) of pT1 bladder tumor were selected for the analyses. Clinic information of the patients was retrieved from their medical records. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The probability of recurrence and progression by multivariate analyses was used as a surrogate marker to construct receiver operating curve (ROC). Results showed that variables including time to prior recurrence time, prior treatment, number of tumor, tumor size, tumor grade, and time of instillation after surgery were associated with the repeated recurrence of pT1 bladder tumor (P{\textless}0.05). The variables including time to prior recurrence time, tumor size, tumor grade, carcinoma in situ (CIS), and time of instillation after surgery were associated with progression of pT1 bladder tumor (P{\textless}0.05). In the present study, the multivariate model showed an area under ROC (AUC) value of 0.754 and 0.798 for tumor recurrence and progression, respectively, which was more effective in prediction than a single risk factor. In conclusion, we have identified several risk factors relevant to RFS and PFS for patients who have had a history of recurrence of pT1 bladder tumor after TUR. These predictive factors may help urologists to stratify patients into distinct risk groups of recurrence and progression, which probably contributes to the individualized treatment for patients.},

abstract = {Introduction One of the factors responsible for the risk of recurrence after complete transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is the quality of surgery that may vary between individual surgeons. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the surgeon on recurrence-free survival in patients with NMIBC. Material and methods The long-term results of a series of consecutive TURBTs performed by five staff urologists at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 949 cases of organ-preserving treatment in 784 patients with NMIBC were included in the analysis. Results With the median follow-up of 64.3 months (3-124 months), the 5-year recurrence-free survival rates according to the surgeon were 62.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 56.2-69.7{\%}), 53.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 47.4-59.9{\%}), 51.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 39.6-62.4{\%}), 46.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 36.4-56.0{\%}), and 44.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 36.8-51.7{\%}), respectively (p {\textless}0.0001). In the multivariate analysis including all potential risk factors, the individual surgeon was associated with a risk of recurrence with a high degree of statistical significance (p = 0.0013). The between-surgeon differences in the recurrence risk were not that pronounced in less extensive tumors. Conclusions A surgeon has a significant impact on the risk of recurrence after curative treatment of patients with NMIBC. This effect was observed despite the relatively extensive experience in bladder endoscopic surgery of all of the surgeons and practicing in a setting of one specialized center. These findings should be taken into account while performing and evaluating the results of comparative studies.},

Applicability of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment (CUETO) models in NMIBC patients is still controversial. Aim of the study was to assess the performance of EORTC and CUETO predictive models in NMIBC patients treated with second TUR. Methods: 479 NMIBC patients with routine second TUR were analyzed retrospectively between 2003 and 2011, and investigated with clinical and pathological variables in regard to tumor recurrence and progression.

Results: With a median follow-up of 60 months, prior recurrence rate, grade, and second TUR pathology were independent prognostic factors for the risk of disease recurrence and progression. The concordance index of the EORTC and the CUETO model was 0.563 and 0.516 for recurrence and 0.681 and 0.702 for progression, respectively. The positive pathology after second TUR was significantly associated with risk of disease recurrence and progression.

Aim of the study was to assess the performance of EORTC and CUETO predictive models in NMIBC patients treated with second TUR. Methods: 479 NMIBC patients with routine second TUR were analyzed retrospectively between 2003 and 2011, and investigated with clinical and pathological variables in regard to tumor recurrence and progression.

abstract = {Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the stage pT1nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a high probability of recurrence after initial diagnosis and treatment. However, risk factors predictive of repeated recurrence and progression of pT1 bladder tumors after primary relapse have not been uncovered. Thus, we conducted the retrospective study. A total of 418 patients who suffered initial recurrence after transurethral resection (TUR) of pT1 bladder tumor were selected for the analyses. Clinic information of the patients was retrieved from their medical records. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The probability of recurrence and progression by multivariate analyses was used as a surrogate marker to construct receiver operating curve (ROC). Results showed that variables including time to prior recurrence time, prior treatment, number of tumor, tumor size, tumor grade, and time of instillation after surgery were associated with the repeated recurrence of pT1 bladder tumor (P{\textless}0.05). The variables including time to prior recurrence time, tumor size, tumor grade, carcinoma in situ (CIS), and time of instillation after surgery were associated with progression of pT1 bladder tumor (P{\textless}0.05). In the present study, the multivariate model showed an area under ROC (AUC) value of 0.754 and 0.798 for tumor recurrence and progression, respectively, which was more effective in prediction than a single risk factor. In conclusion, we have identified several risk factors relevant to RFS and PFS for patients who have had a history of recurrence of pT1 bladder tumor after TUR. These predictive factors may help urologists to stratify patients into distinct risk groups of recurrence and progression, which probably contributes to the individualized treatment for patients.},

abstract = {Introduction One of the factors responsible for the risk of recurrence after complete transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is the quality of surgery that may vary between individual surgeons. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the surgeon on recurrence-free survival in patients with NMIBC. Material and methods The long-term results of a series of consecutive TURBTs performed by five staff urologists at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 949 cases of organ-preserving treatment in 784 patients with NMIBC were included in the analysis. Results With the median follow-up of 64.3 months (3-124 months), the 5-year recurrence-free survival rates according to the surgeon were 62.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 56.2-69.7{\%}), 53.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 47.4-59.9{\%}), 51.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 39.6-62.4{\%}), 46.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 36.4-56.0{\%}), and 44.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 36.8-51.7{\%}), respectively (p {\textless}0.0001). In the multivariate analysis including all potential risk factors, the individual surgeon was associated with a risk of recurrence with a high degree of statistical significance (p = 0.0013). The between-surgeon differences in the recurrence risk were not that pronounced in less extensive tumors. Conclusions A surgeon has a significant impact on the risk of recurrence after curative treatment of patients with NMIBC. This effect was observed despite the relatively extensive experience in bladder endoscopic surgery of all of the surgeons and practicing in a setting of one specialized center. These findings should be taken into account while performing and evaluating the results of comparative studies.},

Patients and methods A multi-institutional database of 5,122 patients with TaT1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder with or without adjuvant therapy at 8 institutions between 1996 and 2007. Multivariable Cox-regression analyses addressed factors associated with disease recurrence and progression. The net reclassification index was used to compare the performance of the EAU categories with the EORTC scoring system. Results Of 5,122 patients, 632 (12.3{\%}), 2,302 (45.0{\%}), and 2,188 (42.7{\%}) were assigned to the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk EAU category, respectively. Within a median follow-up of 62 months (interquartile range: 27–97), 2,365 (46.2{\%}) and 516 (10.1{\%}) patients experienced disease recurrence and progression, respectively. In multivariable Cox-regression analyses, EAU intermediate- and high-risk categories were associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence (P{\textless}0.001) and progression (P{\textless}0.001) compared to low-risk patients. Application of the EAU categories reclassified 1,940 (37.9{\%}) patients into a higher risk group for recurrence. Likewise, 602 (11.8{\%}) patients were reclassified to a higher and 278 (5.4{\%}) to a lower risk group for progression. The net reclassification index of the EAU risk stratification was 0.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: −3.1{\%} to 3.2{\%}) for recurrence and 10.1{\%} (95{\%} CI: −8.0{\%} to 12.0{\%}) for progression, respectively. Conclusions Compared to EORTC risk stratification, the EAU categories reclassifies 37.9{\%} patients into a higher risk group of recurrence and 11.8{\%} into a higher risk of progression. However, the novel risk stratification assigns most patients to the same treatment as the more complex EORTC tables and can be regarded as an alternative tool for treatment decision-making.},

abstract = {Background: miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. The rapidly developing field of microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq; small RNA-seq) needs comprehensive, robust, user-friendly and standardized bioinformatics tools to analyze these large datasets. We present miRge 2.0, in which multiple enhancements were made towards these goals. Results: miRge 2.0 has become more comprehensive with increased functionality including a novel miRNA detection method, A-to-I editing analysis, integrated standardized GFF3 isomiR reporting, and improved alignment to miRNAs. The novel miRNA detection method uniquely uses both miRNA hairpin sequence structure and composition of isomiRs resulting in higher specificity for potential miRNA identification. Using known miRNA data, our support vector machine (SVM) model predicted miRNAs with an average Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.939 over 32 human cell datasets and outperformed miRDeep2 and miRAnalyzer regarding phylogenetic conservation. The A-to-I editing detection strongly correlated with a reference dataset with adjusted R2 = 0.96. miRge 2.0 is the most up-to-date aligner with custom libraries to both miRBase v22 and MirGeneDB v2.0 for 6 species: human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, nematode and zebrafish; and has a tool to create custom libraries. For user-friendliness, miRge 2.0 is incorporated into bcbio-nextgen and implementable through Bioconda.

abstract = {Context: This review focuses on the most widely used risk stratification and prediction tools for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Objective: To assess the clinical use and relevance of risk stratification and prediction tools to enhance clinical decision making and counselling of patients with NMIBC. Evidence acquisition: The most frequent, currently used risk stratification tools and prognostic models for NMIBC patients were identified by the members of the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Panel on NMIBC. Evidence synthesis: The 2006 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables are the most widely used and validated tools for risk stratification and prognosis prediction in NMIBC patients. The EAU risk categories constitute a simple alternative to the EORTC risk tables and can be used for comparable risk stratification. In the subgroup of NMIBC patients treated with a short maintenance schedule of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the Club Urol{\'{o}}gico Espa{\~{n}}ol de Tratamiento Oncol{\'{o}}gico (CUETO) scoring model is more accurate than the EORTC risk tables. Both the EORTC risk tables and the CUETO scoring model overestimate the recurrence and progression risks in patients treated according to current guidelines. The new concept of conditional recurrence and progression estimates is very promising during follow-up but should be validated. Conclusions: Risk stratification and prognostic models enable outcome comparisons and standardisation of treatment and follow-up. At present, none of the available risk stratification and prognostic models reflects current standards of treatment. The EORTC risk tables and CUETO scoring model should be updated with previously unavailable data and recalculated. Patient summary: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease. A risk-based therapeutic approach is recommended. We present available risk stratification and prediction tools and the degree of their validation with the aim to increase their use in everyday clinical practice. Risk stratification and prognostic models are of great importance because they enable standardisation of the treatment and follow-up, and data comparison. The low overall performance reflects the need for biomarkers that measure the biological potential of tumours.},

abstract = {Objective: For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT), significant pathological response of the primary tumor has been proposed to identify candidates for organ preservation. However, this does not address metastatic lymph nodes in the mesorectum. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of lymph node metastases in ypT0 patients treated with NCRT and curative resection and to explore risk factors associated with survival. Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with ypT0 rectal cancer after NCRT and curative resection at a tertiary care center in China from 2005 to 2014. Results: A total of 60 (18.6{\%}) patients who underwent surgery after NCRT and achieved ypT0 were enrolled in this study; one patient was excluded owing to lack of follow-up. Of these 59 patients, lymph node metastases were found in the mesorectum (ypT0N+) in eight (13.6{\%}) patients. After a median follow-up of 52 months, 5-year recurrence-free survival (82.7{\%} vs. 62.5{\%}, P=0.014) and overall survival (OS) (90.9{\%} vs. 70.0{\%}, P=0.032) were much higher in ypN0 than ypN+ patients. Multivariate analyses showed that ypN+ status (P=0.009) and perioperative blood transfusion (BT) (P=0.001) were significantly independent risk factors associated with recurrence; however, no factor was correlated with 5-year OS. Conclusions: Patients with ypT0N0 rectal cancer can achieve excellent long-term outcomes; however, positive lymph nodes or tumor deposits can still be found in 13.6{\%} of ypT0 patients. Nodal positivity in the mesorectum and perioperative BT are independent risk factors for recurrence.},

abstract = {Importance: The watch-and-wait (WW) strategy aims to spare patients with rectal cancer unnecessary resection. Objective: To analyze the outcomes of WW among patients with rectal cancer who had a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case series analysis conducted at a comprehensive cancer center in New York included patients who received a diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma between January 1, 2006, and January 31, 2015. The median follow-up was 43 months. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2016, to October 1, 2018. Exposures: Patients had a clinical complete response after completing neoadjuvant therapy and agreed to a WW strategy of active surveillance and possible salvage surgery (n = 113), or patients underwent total mesorectal excision and were found to have a pathologic complete response (pCR) at resection (n = 136). Main Outcomes and Measures: Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analyses of local regrowth and 5-year rates of overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival. Results: Compared with the 136 patients in the pCR group, the 113 patients in the WW group were older (median [range], 67.2 [32.1-90.9] vs 57.3 [25.0-87.9] years, P {\textless}.001) with cancers closer to the anal verge (median [range] height from anal verge, 5.5 [0.0-15.0] vs 7.0 [0.0-13.0] cm). All 22 local regrowths in the WW group were detected on routine surveillance and treated by salvage surgery (20 total mesorectal excisions plus 2 transanal excisions). Pelvic control after salvage surgery was maintained in 20 of 22 patients (91{\%}). No pelvic recurrences occurred in the pCR group. Rectal preservation was achieved in 93 of 113 patients (82{\%}) in the WW group (91 patients with no local regrowths plus 2 patients with local regrowths salvaged with transanal excision). At 5 years, overall survival was 73{\%} (95{\%} CI, 60{\%}-89{\%}) in the WW group and 94{\%} (95{\%} CI, 90{\%}-99{\%}) in the pCR group; disease-free survival was 75{\%} (95{\%} CI, 62{\%}-90{\%}) in the WW group and 92{\%} (95{\%} CI, 87{\%}-98{\%}) in the pCR group; and disease-specific survival was 90{\%} (95{\%} CI, 81{\%}-99{\%}) in the WW group and 98{\%} (95{\%} CI, 95{\%}-100{\%}) in the pCR group. A higher rate of distant metastasis was observed among patients in the WW group who had local regrowth vs those who did not have local regrowth (36{\%} vs 1{\%}, P {\textless}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: A WW strategy for select rectal cancer patients who had a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy resulted in excellent rectal preservation and pelvic tumor control; however, in the WW group, worse survival was noted along with a higher incidence of distant progression in patients with local regrowth vs those without local regrowth.},

abstract = {Context: This review focuses on the most widely used risk stratification and prediction tools for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Objective: To assess the clinical use and relevance of risk stratification and prediction tools to enhance clinical decision making and counselling of patients with NMIBC. Evidence acquisition: The most frequent, currently used risk stratification tools and prognostic models for NMIBC patients were identified by the members of the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Panel on NMIBC. Evidence synthesis: The 2006 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables are the most widely used and validated tools for risk stratification and prognosis prediction in NMIBC patients. The EAU risk categories constitute a simple alternative to the EORTC risk tables and can be used for comparable risk stratification. In the subgroup of NMIBC patients treated with a short maintenance schedule of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the Club Urol{\'{o}}gico Espa{\~{n}}ol de Tratamiento Oncol{\'{o}}gico (CUETO) scoring model is more accurate than the EORTC risk tables. Both the EORTC risk tables and the CUETO scoring model overestimate the recurrence and progression risks in patients treated according to current guidelines. The new concept of conditional recurrence and progression estimates is very promising during follow-up but should be validated. Conclusions: Risk stratification and prognostic models enable outcome comparisons and standardisation of treatment and follow-up. At present, none of the available risk stratification and prognostic models reflects current standards of treatment. The EORTC risk tables and CUETO scoring model should be updated with previously unavailable data and recalculated. Patient summary: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease. A risk-based therapeutic approach is recommended. We present available risk stratification and prediction tools and the degree of their validation with the aim to increase their use in everyday clinical practice. Risk stratification and prognostic models are of great importance because they enable standardisation of the treatment and follow-up, and data comparison. The low overall performance reflects the need for biomarkers that measure the biological potential of tumours.},

abstract = {Context: This review focuses on the prediction of recurrence and progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and the treatments advocated for this disease. Objective: To review the current status of epidemiology, recurrence, and progression of NMIBC and the state-of-the art treatment for this disease. Evidence acquisition: A literature search in English was performed using PubMed and the guidelines of the European Association of Urology and the American Urological Association. Relevant papers on epidemiology, recurrence, progression, and management of NMIBC were selected. Special attention was given to fluorescent cystoscopy, the new World Health Organisation 2004 classification system for grade, and the role of substaging of T1 NMIBC. Evidence synthesis: In NMIBC, approximately 70{\%} of patients present as pTa, 20{\%} as pT1, and 10{\%} with carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions. Bladder cancer (BCa) is the fifth most frequent type of cancer in western society and the most expensive cancer per patient. Recurrence (in ≤80{\%} of patients) is the main problem for pTa NMIBC patients, whereas progression (in ≤45{\%} of patients) is the main threat in pT1 and CIS NMIBC. In a recent European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer analysis, multiplicity, tumour size, and prior recurrence rate are the most important variables for recurrence. Tumour grade, stage, and CIS are the most important variables for progression. Treatment ranges from transurethral resection (TUR) followed by a single chemotherapy instillation in low-risk NMIBC to, sometimes, re-TUR and adjuvant intravesical therapy in intermediate- and high-risk patients to early cystectomy for treatment-refractory high-risk NMIBC. Conclusions: NMIBC is a heterogeneous disease with varying therapies, follow-up strategies, and oncologic outcomes for an individual patient. {\textcopyright} 2009 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to confirm the utility of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment (CUETO) scoring systems and to determine which model is preferred as a prognostic model in Korean patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Materials and Methods: Between 1985 and 2011, 531 patients who were treated by transurethral resection of bladder cancer were retrospectively analyzed by use of the EORTC and CUETO models. Statistically, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; calculated Harrell's concordance index, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and cutoff values; and performed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.
Conclusions: Both scoring systems, especially the CUETO model, showed value in predicting recurrence and progression in Korean patients, which will help in individualizing treatment and follow-up schedules.
Results: For risk of recurrence, with the use of the EORTC model, all groups had statistically significant differences except between the group with a score of 0 and the group with a score of 1-4. With the use of the CUETO model, all groups differed significantly. For risk of progression, with the use of the EORTC model, significant differences were observed between all groups except between the group with a score of 2-6 and the group with a score of 7-13. With the use of the CUETO model, a significant difference was observed between the group with a score of 0 and the other groups. The concordance index of the EORTC and CUETO models was 0.759 and 0.836 for recurrence and 0.704 and 0.745 for progression, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the EORTC and CUETO models was 0.832 and 0.894 for recurrence and 0.722 and 0.724 for progression, respectively.},

@article{Hernandez2011,
abstract = {Purpose: To perform an external validation of the EORTC risk tables and to evaluate their applicability in the patients of our institution by comparing the actual risk of recurrence and progression in our series to those obtained through the application of the EORTC tables. Methods: Retrospective study, based on a prospective cohort of 417 patients in follow-up with primary TaT1 bladder tumors, operated on in our center between 1998 and 2008 and collected in our database. Risk scores were assigned depending on the tumor characteristics to divide our series into four risk groups according to these ratings. An analysis of survival was carried out to calculate the probability of recurrence by the method of Kaplan-Meier. Results: A total of 417 patients with a median follow-up of 59 months were studied. The overall recurrence and progression rates of our series were 25.95{\%} (21.97-30.49) and 4.86{\%} (3.16-7.43) at 1 year and 53.46{\%} (48.06-59.05) and 8.43{\%} (5.95-11.86) at 5 years, respectively. When we compare our rates of recurrence and progression by groups with the corresponding values from Sylvester's publication, an overlapping of the confidence intervals between both populations is detected. Conclusions: In terms of the applicability of the EORTC risk tables in our patients' population, we conclude that these tables predict accurately the clinical course of patients with NMIBC. Due to the sample size of our study, we can only validate the recurrence model of the EORTC tables. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the consistency of the results of patients who were treated for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in our clinic with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk table. Material and methods: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 452 patients who had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-BT) between the years 2002, and 2010 for primary or recurrent NMIBC. Our study had a retrospective design but based on prospective cohort study. Patients were staged according to the 2002 Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) classification and the 1973 World Health Organization grading system. Recurrence was defined as non-muscle-invasive or muscle-invasive and progression as muscle-invasive tumor determined based on following cystoscopy and TUR-BT results, and confirmed by histopathologic analysis. Patients in the current study were classified into four groups according to the EORTC risk tables. Time to first recurrence and progression was determined for each risk group. Results: Of the 452 patients, 348 were enrolled in this study. The overall mean follow-up period was 55.25 months of all patients. Of 348 patients, 130 (37.4{\%}) and 258 patients (74.1{\%}) had recurrence after treatment at the 1 and 5 year follow-up period, respectively. While 35 (10.1{\%}) and 99 patients (28.4{\%}) progressed to muscle-invasive cancer at the 1 and 5 year follow-up period, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, grade, number, size of the tumor size, and concomitant carcinoma in situ were found to be statistically significant for disease progression and recurrence. Conclusion: When EORTC risk tables were comparatively evaluated in our patient population, we can say that EORTC tables predict nearly accurately the clinical course of patients with NMIBC.},

abstract = {The concordance probability is a widely used measure to assess discrimination of prognostic models with binary and survival endpoints. We formally define the concordance probability for a prognostic model of the absolute risk of an event of interest in the presence of competing risks and relate it to recently proposed time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve measures. For right-censored data, we investigate inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) estimates of a truncated concordance index based on a working model for the censoring distribution. We demonstrate consistency and asymptotic normality of the IPCW estimate if the working model is correctly specified and derive an explicit formula for the asymptotic variance under independent censoring. The small sample properties of the estimator are assessed in a simulation study also against misspecification of the working model. We further illustrate the methods by computing the concordance probability for a prognostic model of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the presence of the competing risk of non-CHD death. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {Background Clinical outcomes after major surgery are poorly described at the national level. Evidence of heterogeneity between hospitals and health-care systems suggests potential to improve care for patients but this potential remains unconfirmed. The European Surgical Outcomes Study was an international study designed to assess outcomes after non-cardiac surgery in Europe. Methods We did this 7 day cohort study between April 4 and April 11, 2011. We collected data describing consecutive patients aged 16 years and older undergoing inpatient non-cardiac surgery in 498 hospitals across 28 European nations. Patients were followed up for a maximum of 60 days. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcome measures were duration of hospital stay and admission to critical care. We used $\chi$ 2 and Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical variables and the t test or the Mann-Whitney U test to compare continuous variables. Significance was set at p{\textless}0 05. We constructed multilevel logistic regression models to adjust for the differences in mortality rates between countries. Findings We included 46 539 patients, of whom 1855 (4{\%}) died before hospital discharge. 3599 (8{\%}) patients were admitted to critical care after surgery with a median length of stay of 1 2 days (IQR 0 9-3 6). 1358 (73{\%}) patients who died were not admitted to critical care at any stage after surgery. Crude mortality rates varied widely between countries (from 1 2{\%} [95{\%} CI 0 0-3 0] for Iceland to 21 5{\%} [16 9-26 2] for Latvia). After adjustment for confounding variables, important differences remained between countries when compared with the UK, the country with the largest dataset (OR range from 0 44 [95{\%} CI 0 19-1 05; p=0 06] for Finland to 6 92 [2 37-20 27; p=0 0004] for Poland). Interpretation The mortality rate for patients undergoing inpatient non-cardiac surgery was higher than anticipated. Variations in mortality between countries suggest the need for national and international strategies to improve care for this group of patients.

abstract = {Background: Studies evaluating titration of antihypertensive medication using self-monitoring give contradictory findings and the precise place of telemonitoring over self-monitoring alone is unclear. The TASMINH4 trial aimed to assess the efficacy of self-monitored blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, for antihypertensive titration in primary care, compared with usual care. Methods: This study was a parallel randomised controlled trial done in 142 general practices in the UK, and included hypertensive patients older than 35 years, with blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg, who were willing to self-monitor their blood pressure. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to self-monitoring blood pressure (self-montoring group), to self-monitoring blood pressure with telemonitoring (telemonitoring group), or to usual care (clinic blood pressure; usual care group). Randomisation was by a secure web-based system. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was clinic measured systolic blood pressure at 12 months from randomisation. Primary analysis was of available cases. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 83571366. Findings: 1182 participants were randomly assigned to the self-monitoring group (n=395), the telemonitoring group (n=393), or the usual care group (n=394), of whom 1003 (85{\%}) were included in the primary analysis. After 12 months, systolic blood pressure was lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care (self-monitoring, 137{\textperiodcentered}0 [SD 16{\textperiodcentered}7] mm Hg and telemonitoring, 136{\textperiodcentered}0 [16{\textperiodcentered}1] mm Hg vs usual care, 140{\textperiodcentered}4 [16{\textperiodcentered}5]; adjusted mean differences vs usual care: self-monitoring alone, −3{\textperiodcentered}5 mm Hg [95{\%} CI −5{\textperiodcentered}8 to −1{\textperiodcentered}2]; telemonitoring, −4{\textperiodcentered}7 mm Hg [–7{\textperiodcentered}0 to −2{\textperiodcentered}4]). No difference between the self-monitoring and telemonitoring groups was recorded (adjusted mean difference −1{\textperiodcentered}2 mm Hg [95{\%} CI −3{\textperiodcentered}5 to 1{\textperiodcentered}2]). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses including multiple imputation. Adverse events were similar between all three groups. Interpretation: Self-monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, when used by general practitioners to titrate antihypertensive medication in individuals with poorly controlled blood pressure, leads to significantly lower blood pressure than titration guided by clinic readings. With most general practitioners and many patients using self-monitoring, it could become the cornerstone of hypertension management in primary care.

abstract = {Background Alcohol-induced hangover constitutes a significant, yet understudied, global hazard and a large socio-economic burden. Old folk wisdoms such as "Beer before wine and you'll feel fine; wine before beer and you'll feel queer" exist in many languages. However, whether these concepts in fact reduce hangover severity is unclear. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the combination and order of beer and wine consumption on hangover intensity. Methods In this multiarm, parallel randomized controlled matched-Triplet crossover open-label interventional trial, participants were matched into triplets and randomly assigned according to age, gender, body composition, alcohol drinking habits, and hangover frequency. Study group 1 consumed beer up to a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) ≥0.05{\%} and then wine to BrAC ≥0.11{\%} (vice versa for study group 2). Control group subjects consumed either only beer or only wine. On a second intervention day (crossover) ≥1 wk later, study-group subjects were switched to the opposite drinking order. Control-group subjects who drank only beer on the first intervention received only wine on the second study day (and vice versa). Primary endpoint was hangover severity assessed by Acute Hangover Scale rating on the day following each intervention. Secondary endpoints were factors associated with hangover intensity. Results Ninety participants aged 19-40 y (mean age 23.9), 50{\%} female, were included (study group 1 n = 31, study group 2 n = 31, controls n = 28). Neither type nor order of consumed alcoholic beverages significantly affected hangover intensity (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Multivariate regression analyses revealed perceived drunkenness and vomiting as the strongest predictors for hangover intensity. Conclusions Our findings dispel the traditional myths "Grape or grain but never the twain" and "Beer before wine and you'll feel fine; wine before beer and you'll feel queer" regarding moderate-To-severe alcohol intoxication, whereas subjective signs of progressive intoxication were confirmed as accurate predictors of hangover severity. This trial was prospectively registered at the Witten/Herdecke University Ethics Committee as 140/2016 and retrospectively registered at the German Clinical Trials Register as DRKS00015285.},

abstract = {Purpose: To provide recommendations on appropriate clinical trial designs in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) based on current literature and expert consensus of the International Bladder Cancer Group. Methods: We reviewed published trials, guidelines, meta-analyses, and reviews and provided recommendations on eligibility criteria, baseline evaluations, end points, study designs, comparators, clinically meaningful magnitude of effect, and sample size. Results: NMIBC trials must be designed to provide the most clinically relevant data for the specific risk category of interest (low, intermediate, or high). Specific eligibility criteria and baseline evaluations depend on the risk category being studied. For the population of patients for whom bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) has failed, the type of failure (BCG unresponsive, refractory, relapsing, or intolerant) should be clearly defined to make comparisons across trials feasible. Single-arm designs may be relevant for the BCG-unresponsive population. Here, a clinically meaningful initial complete response rate (for carcinoma in situ) or recurrence-free rate (for papillary tumors) of at least 50{\%} at 6 months, 30{\%} at 12 months, and 25{\%} at 18 months is recommended. For other risk levels, randomized superiority trial designs are recommended; noninferiority trials are to be used sparingly given the large sample size required. Placebo control is considered unethical for all intermediate- and high-risk strata; therefore, control arms should comprise the current guideline-recommended standard of care for the respective risk level. In general, trials should use time to recurrence or recurrence-free survival as the primary end point and time to progression, toxicity, disease-specific survival, and overall survival as potential secondary end points. Realistic efficacy thresholds should be set to ensure that novel therapies receive due review by regulatory bodies. Conclusion: The International Bladder Cancer Group has developed formal recommendations regarding definitions, end points, and clinical trial designs for NMIBC to encourage uniformity among studies in this disease.},

abstract = {Segmentation and detection of mitotic nuclei is a challenging task. To address this problem, a Transfer Learning based fast and accurate system is proposed. To give the classifier a balanced dataset, this work exploits the concept of Transfer Learning by first using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation, and then another Hybrid-CNN (with Weights Transfer and custom layers) for classification of mitoses. First, mitotic nuclei are automatically annotated, based on the ground truth centroids. The segmentation module then segments mitotic nuclei and also produces some false positives. Finally, the detection module is trained on the patches from the segmentation module and performs the final detection. Fine-tuning based Transfer Learning reduced training time, provided good initial weights, and improved the detection rate with F-measure of 0.713 and 76{\%} area under the precision-recall curve for the challenging task of mitosis detection.},

abstract = {Context and objective: To present the 2011 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Evidence acquisition: Literature published between 2004 and 2010 on the diagnosis and treatment of NMIBC was systematically reviewed. Previous guidelines were updated, and the level of evidence (LE) and grade of recommendation (GR) were assigned. Evidence synthesis: Tumours staged as Ta, T1, or carcinoma in situ (CIS) are grouped as NMIBC. Diagnosis depends on cystoscopy and histologic evaluation of the tissue obtained by transurethral resection (TUR) in papillary tumours or by multiple bladder biopsies in CIS. In papillary lesions, a complete TUR is essential for the patient's prognosis. Where the initial resection is incomplete or where a high-grade or T1 tumour is detected, a second TUR should be performed within 2-6 wk. In papillary tumours, the risks of both recurrence and progression may be estimated for individual patients using the scoring system and risk tables. The stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups - separately for recurrence and progression - is pivotal to recommending adjuvant treatment. For patients with a low risk of tumour recurrence and progression, one immediate instillation of chemotherapy is recommended. Patients with an intermediate or high risk of recurrence and an intermediate risk of progression should receive one immediate instillation of chemotherapy followed by a minimum of 1 yr of bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy or further instillations of chemotherapy. Papillary tumours with a high risk of progression and CIS should receive intravesical BCG for 1 yr. Cystectomy may be offered to the highest risk patients, and it is at least recommended in BCG failure patients. The long version of the guidelines is available from the EAU Web site (www.uroweb.org).

abstract = {Context: New data regarding treatment of muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (MiM-BC) has emerged and led to an update of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for MiM-BC. Objective: To review the new EAU guidelines for MiM-BC with a specific focus on treatment. Evidence acquisition: New literature published since the last update of the EAU guidelines in 2008 was obtained from Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists in publications and review articles and comprehensively screened by a group of urologists, oncologists, and a radiologist appointed by the EAU Guidelines Office. Previous recommendations based on the older literature on this subject were also taken into account. Levels of evidence (LEs) and grades of recommendations (GRs) were added based on a system modified from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Evidence synthesis: Current data demonstrate that neoadjuvant chemotherapy in conjunction with radical cystectomy (RC) is recommended in certain constellations of MiM-BC. RC remains the basic treatment of choice in localised invasive disease for both sexes. An attempt has been made to define the extent of surgery under standard conditions in both sexes. An orthotopic bladder substitute should be offered to both male and female patients lacking any contraindications, such as no tumour at the level of urethral dissection. In contrast to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, current advice recommends the use of adjuvant chemotherapy only within clinical trials. Multimodality bladder-preserving treatment in localised disease is currently regarded only as an alternative in selected, well-informed, and compliant patients for whom cystectomy is not considered for medical or personal reasons. In metastatic disease, the first-line treatment for patients fit enough to sustain cisplatin remains cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy. With the advent of vinflunine, second-line chemotherapy has become available. Conclusions: In the treatment of localised invasive bladder cancer (BCa), the standard treatment remains radical surgical removal of the bladder within standard limits, including as-yet-unspecified regional lymph nodes. However, the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy must be considered for certain specific patient groups. A new drug for second-line chemotherapy (vinflunine) in metastatic disease has been approved and is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2011 AEU. Published by Elsevier Espa{\~{n}}a, S.L.

abstract = {Background Few studies have investigated the natural history of TaG1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB). Objective To assess the long-term outcomes of patients with TaG1 UCB and the impact of immediate postoperative instillation of chemotherapy (IPIC). Design, setting, and participants A retrospective analysis of 1447 patients with TaG1 UCB treated between 1996 and 2007 at eight centers. Median follow-up was 67.2 mo (interquartile range: 67.9). Patients were stratified into three European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines risk categories; high-risk patients (n = 11) were excluded. Intervention Transurethral resection of the bladder with or without IPIC. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models addressed factors associated with disease recurrence, disease progression, death of disease, and any-cause death. Results and limitations Of the 1436 patients, 601 (41.9{\%}) and 835 (58.1{\%}) were assigned to low- and intermediate-risk categories, respectively. The actuarial estimate of 5-yr recurrence-free survival was 56{\%} (standard error: ±1). Advancing age (p = 0.04), tumor {\textgreater}3 cm (p = 0.001), multiple tumors (p {\textless} 0.001), and recurrent tumors (p {\textless} 0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of disease recurrence, whereas IPIC was associated with decreased risk (p = 0.001). The actuarial estimate of 5-yr progression-free survival was 95{\%} ± 1. Advancing age (p {\textless} 0.001) and multiple tumors (p = 0.01) were independent risk factors for disease progression. Five-year cancer-specific survival was 98{\%} ± 1. Advancing age (p = 0.001) and previous recurrence (p = 0.04) were associated with increased risk, whereas female gender (p = 0.02) was associated with decreased risk of cancer-specific mortality. Compared with low-risk patients, intermediate-risk patients were at significantly higher risk of disease recurrence, disease progression, and cancer-specific mortality (all p {\textless} 0.01). Limitations include the retrospective design of the study and the lack of a central pathology review. Conclusions TaG1 UCB patients experience heterogeneous risks of disease recurrence. We validated the EAU guidelines risk stratification in TaG1 UCB patients.

abstract = {Background: Patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) need accurate estimations of the risk of recurrence and progression. Physicians can offer individualized therapy after identifying high-risk tumors. In our study, we compared the applicability of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables and American Urological Association (AUA) risk stratification in Chinese patients with NMIBC. Methods: We retrospectively studied 301 patients with NMIBC who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) between October 2000 and July 2009 at Huashan Hospital of Fudan University and analyzed their parameters. The recurrence and progression rates at 1 and 5 years postoperatively were calculated along with 95{\%} confidence intervals. We compared them with results obtained from the EORTC risk tables and AUA risk stratification. P values {\textless}.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The median patient age was 67 years (21–92 years) and the median follow-up duration was 46 months (2–151 months). We used EORTC risk tables to classify patients into 3 groups, depending on whether they suffered recurrence or progression after TURBT. Kaplan–Meier curves showed significant differences among the 3 recurrence-free survival (RFS) levels (P {\textless} .0001, log-rank test) and among the 3 progression-free survival (PFS) levels (P {\textless} .0001, log-rank test). AUA risk stratification showed the same results. Both classifications were suitable to predict recurrence and progression in Chinese patients. However, for high-risk patients in both series, Kaplan–Meier curves showed significant differences between RFS levels (P {\textless} .0001, log-rank test) and between PFS levels (P {\textless} .0001, log-rank test). EORTC risk tables were stricter and AUA was more sensitive in assigning patients to a high-risk group. Conclusion: EORTC risk tables are better than AUA risk stratification for predicting recurrence and progression in Chinese patients with NMIBC, especially among high-risk patients.},

Thirty-eight training hospitals participated in this retrospective multicenter study. Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 1,587 patients with newly diagnosed non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were enrolled in this study. Patients with prior histories of bladder cancer, non-transitional cell carcinoma, or a follow-up duration of less than 12 months were excluded. With univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we constructed nomograms to predict disease recurrence, and internal validation was performed using statistical techniques. Three-year and five-year recurrence-free rates were 64.3{\%} and 55.3{\%}, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (hazard ratio [HR]=1.437, p{\textless} 0.001), tumor size (HR=1.328, p=0.001), multiplicity (HR=1.505, p{\textless}0.001), tumor grade (HR=1.347, p=0.007), concomitant carcinoma in situ (HR=1.611, p=0.007), and intravesical therapy (HR=0.681, p{\textless}0.001) were independent predictors for disease recurrence. Based on these prognostic factors, nomograms for the prediction of disease recurrence were developed.

abstract = {Purpose: To develop and validate novel nomograms to predict recurrence and progression after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in Korean patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on 970 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients after TURBT between 2000 and 2013 in a single institution. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify the significant predictors of recurrence and progression, which resulted in the construction of the nomograms predicting the 5-year probability of recurrence and progression. We internally validated the nomograms using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics' curves and calibration plots. In addition, the clinical usefulness of each nomogram was assessed and compared with that of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-scoring system using decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: The significant factors related to recurrence were gross hematuria at diagnosis, previous or concomitant upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), pT1 tumor, high tumor grade, multiple tumors, and intravesical therapy. The significant predictors of progression were previous or concomitant UTUC, pT1 tumor, high tumor grade, carcinoma in situ, and lymphovascular invasion. The 5-year predictive accuracy of each nomogram was 65{\%} for recurrence and 70{\%} for progression, respectively. Compared with the EORTC-scoring system, the nomograms were generally well calibrated. On DCA, each nomogram presented better net benefit gains than did the EORTC-scoring system across a wide range of threshold probabilities. Conclusions: Our novel nomograms are not completely accurate, but they show a reasonable level of discriminative ability, adequate calibration, and meaningful net benefit gain for the prediction of recurrence and progression after TURBT in Korean NMIBC patients. Additional external validation will be required to generalize the nomograms which we developed.},

abstract = {Context: Some studies report that tumour progression in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is associated with a poor prognosis. However, no systematic evidence is available. Objective: The aim of the study was to systematically review literature to determine the long-term cancer-specific survival in patients with high-risk NMIBC (T1G3, multifocal, highly recurrent, or carcinoma in situ) having tumour progression. Evidence acquisition: A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed and the Cochrane library for studies published between 2006 and 2011. Additional studies were identified by scanning reference lists of relevant papers. We attempted to retrieve missing data by contacting the corresponding author. Keywords used included bladder cancer, high-risk, high grade, carcinoma in situ, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, progression, and survival. Studies were included when they met the following criteria: inclusion of at least 75 patients having high-risk NMIBC, patients were initially treated conservatively with transurethral resection of the bladder tumour and intravesical instillations, a median follow-up of at least 48 mo, and reporting data on progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and death resulting from bladder cancer (BCa). Evidence synthesis: Literature was systematically reviewed, and 19 trials were included, producing a total of 3088 patients, of which 659 (21{\%}) showed progression to MIBC and 428 (14{\%}) died as a result of BCa after a median follow-up of 48-123 mo. Survival after progression from high-risk NMIBC to MIBC was 35{\%}. Progression to MIBC and BCa-related death in high-risk NMIBC were found to be relatively early events, occurring mainly within 48 mo. Finally, even in cases of early cystectomy in patients with high-risk NMIBC, a relevant proportion of these patients appear not be cured of their disease. Conclusions: This study provides systematically gathered evidence showing a poor prognosis for patients with high-risk NMIBC and tumour progression. {\textcopyright} 2011 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Context: This review focuses on the prediction of recurrence and progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and the treatments advocated for this disease. Objective: To review the current status of epidemiology, recurrence, and progression of NMIBC and the state-of-the art treatment for this disease. Evidence acquisition: A literature search in English was performed using PubMed and the guidelines of the European Association of Urology and the American Urological Association. Relevant papers on epidemiology, recurrence, progression, and management of NMIBC were selected. Special attention was given to fluorescent cystoscopy, the new World Health Organisation 2004 classification system for grade, and the role of substaging of T1 NMIBC. Evidence synthesis: In NMIBC, approximately 70{\%} of patients present as pTa, 20{\%} as pT1, and 10{\%} with carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions. Bladder cancer (BCa) is the fifth most frequent type of cancer in western society and the most expensive cancer per patient. Recurrence (in ≤80{\%} of patients) is the main problem for pTa NMIBC patients, whereas progression (in ≤45{\%} of patients) is the main threat in pT1 and CIS NMIBC. In a recent European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer analysis, multiplicity, tumour size, and prior recurrence rate are the most important variables for recurrence. Tumour grade, stage, and CIS are the most important variables for progression. Treatment ranges from transurethral resection (TUR) followed by a single chemotherapy instillation in low-risk NMIBC to, sometimes, re-TUR and adjuvant intravesical therapy in intermediate- and high-risk patients to early cystectomy for treatment-refractory high-risk NMIBC. Conclusions: NMIBC is a heterogeneous disease with varying therapies, follow-up strategies, and oncologic outcomes for an individual patient. {\textcopyright} 2009 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Background: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables only included 171 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Objective: To evaluate the external validity of the EORTC tables in patients with NMIBC treated with BCG over 5-6 mo. Design, setting, and participants: Data on 1062 patients treated with BCG were analyzed. Measurements: Discrimination was assessed using the concordance index (c-index) and the prognostic separation index (PSEP). For calibration, probabilities of recurrence and progression obtained with the EORTC risk tables in our series were compared with those reported by the EORTC. Results and limitations: With respect to the discriminative ability of the EORTC model, c-index was similar to those reported in the EORTC series for recurrence. However, c-indices for progression in our series were lower than c-indices reported by Sylvester et al. [1]. Although PSEP in our series was lower than in the EORTC series for recurrence at 1 yr, similar results were found at 5 yr. Regarding progression, PSEP in our series was lower than in the EORTC series. Whilst a successful stratification of recurrence and progression probability at 1 and 5 yr was achieved using the EORTC tables in our series, model calibration showed lower risks of recurrence than those reported by Sylvester et al. [1] in all groups. For progression, lower risks were found in higher-risk groups. There are some limitations in the present study. A different distribution of patients was found, with higher proportions of primary grade 3 T1 tumors and tumors in situ than in the EORTC series. An additional limitation is that prior recurrence of the EORTC table was not included in our parameters. Consequently, two separate analyses were performed for recurrence. Conclusions: The EORTC model successfully stratified recurrence and progression risks in our cohort. However, the discriminative ability of the EORTC tables decreased in our patients for progression. Moreover, these tables overestimated risks of recurrence and progression after BCG therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Background:The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables and the Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment (CUETO) scoring model are the two best-established predictive tools to help decision making for patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The aim of the current study was to assess the performance of these predictive tools in a large multicentre cohort of NMIBC patients.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of 4689 patients with NMIBC. To evaluate the discrimination of the models, we created Cox proportional hazard regression models for time to disease recurrence and progression. We incorporated the patients calculated risk score as a predictor into both of these models and then calculated their discrimination (concordance indexes). We compared the concordance index of our models with the concordance index reported for the models.Results:With a median follow-up of 57 months, 2110 patients experienced disease recurrence and 591 patients experienced disease progression. Both tools exhibited a poor discrimination for disease recurrence and progression (0.597 and 0.662, and 0.523 and 0.616, respectively, for the EORTC and CUETO models). The EORTC tables overestimated the risk of disease recurrence and progression in high-risk patients. The discrimination of the EORTC tables was even lower in the subgroup of patients treated with BCG (0.554 and 0.576 for disease recurrence and progression, respectively). Conversely, the discrimination of the CUETO model increased in BCG-treated patients (0.597 and 0.645 for disease recurrence and progression, respectively). However, both models overestimated the risk of disease progression in high-risk patients.Conclusion:The EORTC risk tables and the CUETO scoring system exhibit a poor discrimination for both disease recurrence and progression in NMIBC patients. These models overestimated the risk of disease recurrence and progression in high-risk patients. These overestimations remained in BCG-treated patients, especially for the EORTC tables. These results underline the need for improving our current predictive tools. However, our study is limited by its retrospective and multi-institutional design. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cancer Research UK.},

abstract = {Objective: We aimed to determine the validity of two risk scores for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in different European settings, in patients with primary tumours. Methods: We included 1,892 patients with primary stage Ta or T1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a transurethral resection in Spain (n = 973), the Netherlands (n = 639), or Denmark (n = 280). We evaluated recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment (CUETO) risk scores for each patient and used the concordance index (c-index) to indicate discriminative ability. Results: The 3 cohorts were comparable according to age and sex, but patients from Denmark had a larger proportion of patients with the high stage and grade at diagnosis (p{\textless}0.01). At least one recurrence occurred in 839 (44{\%}) patients and 258 (14{\%}) patients had a progression during a median follow-up of 74 months. Patients from Denmark had the highest 10-year recurrence and progression rates (75{\%} and 24{\%}, respectively), whereas patients from Spain had the lowest rates (34{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively). The EORTC and CUETO risk scores both predicted progression better than recurrence with c-indices ranging from 0.72 to 0.82 while for recurrence, those ranged from 0.55 to 0.61. Conclusion: The EORTC and CUETO risk scores can reasonably predict progression, while prediction of recurrence is more difficult. New prognostic markers are needed to better predict recurrence of tumours in primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Vedder et al.},

Materials and Methods: Between 1985 and 2011, 531 patients who were treated by transurethral resection of bladder cancer were retrospectively analyzed by use of the EORTC and CUETO models. Statistically, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; calculated Harrell's concordance index, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and cutoff values; and performed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.
Conclusions: Both scoring systems, especially the CUETO model, showed value in predicting recurrence and progression in Korean patients, which will help in individualizing treatment and follow-up schedules.
Results: For risk of recurrence, with the use of the EORTC model, all groups had statistically significant differences except between the group with a score of 0 and the group with a score of 1-4. With the use of the CUETO model, all groups differed significantly. For risk of progression, with the use of the EORTC model, significant differences were observed between all groups except between the group with a score of 2-6 and the group with a score of 7-13. With the use of the CUETO model, a significant difference was observed between the group with a score of 0 and the other groups. The concordance index of the EORTC and CUETO models was 0.759 and 0.836 for recurrence and 0.704 and 0.745 for progression, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the EORTC and CUETO models was 0.832 and 0.894 for recurrence and 0.722 and 0.724 for progression, respectively.},

abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the validation of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables to predict progression in Brazilian patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Patients and Methods Two hundred five consecutively and prospectively selected patients with NMIBC who underwent transurethral resection were analyzed during 12 years. Six parameters were analyzed: tumor grade, size, and number, pT stage, previous recurrence rate, and carcinoma-in-situ. Time to progression, risk score, and progression probabilities were calculated and compared to probabilities obtained from the EORTC model. The C index was calculated, and accuracy was analyzed for external validation. Results A total of 152 patients had complete follow-up data, 36 died, and 17 were lost to follow-up. One hundred thirty-seven patients had primary tumors and 68 had recurrent tumors. Progression to muscle-invasive disease occurred in 42 patients (20.5{\%}). Significant characteristics related to progression were male gender, pT1 stage, lesion size ≥ 3 cm, high grade of disease, and no combined intravesical therapy. Mean time to progression was 26.9 months; the 1-year progression rate was 3.4{\%} and the 5-year rate was 19.1{\%}. The C index was 0.86 at 1 year and 0.78 at 5 years. For calibration, 1- and 5-year progression rates were lower than the values predicted by EORTC risk tables, mainly in high-risk groups. Although the EORTC model overestimated the short- and long-term risk of progression, an overlapping of the confidence intervals between both populations was detected. Conclusion The EORTC model successfully stratified progression risks in a Brazilian cohort, although it overestimated progression rates. This scoring system is useful in predicting progression of NMIBC; however, updating new risk markers is essential to improve risk classification and prediction of progression.},

abstract = {Validate the EORTC risk tables in Brazilian patients with NMIBC. Methods: 205 patients were analyzed. The 6 parameters analyzed were: histologic grading, pathologic stage, size and number of tumors, previous recurrence rate and concomitant CIS. The time for first recurrence (TFR), risk score and probability of recurrence were calculated and compared to the probabilities obtained from EORTC risk tables. C-index was calculated and accuracy of EORTC tables was analyzed. Results: pTa was presented in 91 (44.4{\%}) patients and pT1 in 114 (55.6{\%}). Ninety-seven (47.3{\%}) patients had solitary tumor, and 108 (52.7{\%}) multiple tumors. One hundred and three (50.2{\%}) patients had tumors smaller than 3 cm and 102 (40.8{\%}) had bigger than 3 cm. Concomitant CIS was observed in 21 (10.2{\%}) patients. Low grade was presented in 95 (46.3{\%}) patients, and high grade in 110 (53.7{\%}). Intravesical therapy was utilized in 105 (56.1{\%}) patients. Recurrence was observed in 117 (57.1{\%}) patients and the mean TFR was 14,2 ± 7,3 months. C-index was 0,72 for 1 year and 0,7 for 5 years. The recurrence risk was 28,8{\%} in 1 year and 57,1{\%} in 5 years, independently of the scoring risk. In our population, the EORTC risk tables overestimated the risk of recurrence in 1 year and underestimated in 5 years. Conclusion: The validation of the EORTC risk tables in Brazilian patients with NMIBC was satisfactory and should be stimulated to predict recurrence, although these may overestimated the risk of recurrence in 1 year and underestimated in 5 years.},

abstract = {A risk calculator algorithm to allow prediction of probabilities of 1- and 5-year recurrence and progression rates in individuals with pTa/pT1 bladder cancer has been proposed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and was incorporated into the European Association of Urology guidelines in 2006. We attempted to validate this algorithm in a cohort of patients with known outcome. Prognostic data were collected from a consecutively presenting cohort of 109 patients with non-muscle invasive (pTa/pT1) transitional cell cancer (TCC) at a single institution between 1983 and 1985. Using the same statistical models as in the EORTC original paper, predicted probabilities of 1- and 5-year recurrence and progression were calculated. Patients were divided into four risk groups for recurrence (Ir-IVr) and progression (Ip-IVp), respectively, using six prognostic criteria. These were then compared to the probabilities predicted in the EORTC algorithm. The predicted 1- and 5-year probabilities of recurrence were significantly higher in the study population as compared to the original EORTC algorithm for all four risk groups. The predicted 1-year probabilities for progression in groups Ip/IIIp and at 5-years for groups Ip/IIp were in accordance with the original algorithm, but were higher for the other progression groups. The concordance for the model of prediction using the study group for recurrence at 1 and 5 years was 62 and 63{\%}, respectively, and for progression was 65 and 67{\%}, respectively. We were unable to validate the proposed algorithm in our group of patients. Although our study has limitations that prevent firm conclusions on the validity of the algorithm, it does expose some of the drawbacks of standardised nomograms when applied to local clinical practice. {\textcopyright}2011 with author.},

abstract = {Purpose: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is the most effective therapy for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Recently to calculate the risks of recurrence and progression based on data from 7 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer trials a scoring system was reported. However, in that series only 171 patients were treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We developed a risk stratification model to provide accurate estimates of recurrence and progression probability after bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Materials and Methods: Data were analyzed on 1,062 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and included in 4 Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment trials. Stepwise multivariate Cox models were used to determine the effect of prognostic factors. In each patient the weight of all factors was summed to a total score. Patients were then divided into groups, and cumulative recurrence and progression rates were calculated. Results: A scoring system was calculated with a score of 0 to 16 for recurrence and 0 to 14 for progression. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by score, and recurrence and progression probabilities were calculated in each group. For recurrence the variables were gender, age, grade, tumor status, multiplicity and associated Tis. For progression the variables were age, grade, tumor status, T category, multiplicity and associated Tis. For recurrence calculated risks using Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment tables were lower than those obtained with Sylvester tables. For progression probabilities were lower in our model only in patients with high risk tumors. Conclusions: We propose a scoring model to stratify the risk of recurrence and progression in patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Urological Association.},

Results: The EORTC model successfully stratified our patients into 4 groups with statistically significant different probabilities of recurrence. For progression, only the intermediate- and high-risk groups could be reasonably distinguished using the EORTC model. The CUETO model stratified neither the recurrence nor the progression risks. The concordance index using the EORTC and CUETO model was 0.711 and 0.663 for recurrence and 0.768 and 0.741 for progression, respectively. Conclusion: Compared with the CUETO risk tables, the EORTC model showed more value in predicting recurrence and progression in Chinese patients with NMIBC, most of whom received intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. Prospective multicenter studies should be performed of large cohorts to construct an ideal prognostic model for Chinese patients with NMIBC. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose We assessed the performance of the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and CUETO (Club Urol{\'{o}}gico Espa{\~{n}}ol de Tratamiento Oncol{\'{o}}gico) nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer predictive models compared to current United States NCCN Guidelines{\textregistered} in an American population. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer in a multicenter population in the United States. We evaluated recurrence-free and progression-free survival according to EORTC and CUETO, and assessed discriminative performance with the c-index at 1 and 5 years. We then compared the discrimination of EORTC and CUETO to the discrimination of the 4 nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer treatment groups described in NCCN Guidelines. Results We identified 1,333 patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer and a median followup of 37 months. At 5 years the recurrence c-index of EORTC and CUETO was 0.59 and 0.56 while for progression it was higher at 0.74 and 0.72, respectively. NCCN Guidelines demonstrated a similar c-index of 0.56 and 0.75, respectively. The discrimination of all 3 risk models decreased in patients who received bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin. EORTC was better able to identify patients at low risk for recurrence or progression but it overestimated the 5-year risk of progression in patients at high risk. This study was limited by its retrospective design. Conclusions Our work illustrates the need for improved predictive tools for clinicians who treat patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. However, until new tools are developed NCCN Guidelines are a simple option for clinicians who treat patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Those guidelines provide predictive power comparable to that of the EORTC and CUETO models.},

abstract = {Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin.

abstract = {Improved approaches for the detection of common epithelial malignancies are urgently needed to reduce the worldwide morbidity and mortality caused by cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (≈22 nt) regulatory RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. We show here that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. miRNAs originating from human prostate cancer xenografts enter the circulation, are readily measured in plasma, and can robustly distinguish xenografted mice from controls. This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of miR-141 (a miRNA expressed in prostate cancer) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls. Our results establish the measurement of tumor-derived miRNAs in serum or plasma as an important approach for the blood-based detection of human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

@article{MacFarlane2010,
abstract = {MicroRNAs are small, highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerases II and III, generating precursors that undergo a series of cleavage events to form mature microRNA. The conventional biogenesis pathway consists of two cleavage events, one nuclear and one cytoplasmic. However, alternative biogenesis pathways exist that differ in the number of cleavage events and enzymes responsible. How microRNA precursors are sorted to the different pathways is unclear but appears to be determined by the site of origin of the microRNA, its sequence and thermodynamic stability. The regulatory functions of microRNAs are accomplished through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). MicroRNA assembles into RISC, activating the complex to target messenger RNA (mRNA) specified by the microRNA. Various RISC assembly models have been proposed and research continues to explore the mechanism(s) of RISC loading and activation. The degree and nature of the complementarity between the microRNA and target determine the gene silencing mechanism, slicer-dependent mRNA degradation or slicer-independent translation inhibition. Recent evidence indicates that P-bodies are essential for microRNA-mediated gene silencing and that RISC assembly and silencing occurs primarily within P-bodies. The P-body model outlines microRNA sorting and shuttling between specialized P-body compartments that house enzymes required for slicer -dependent and -independent silencing, addressing the reversibility of these silencing mechanisms. Detailed knowledge of the microRNA pathways is essential for understanding their physiological role and the implications associated with dysfunction and dysregulation.},

An acute increase in tumor oxygenation before radiation treatment should therefore significantly improve the tumor cell kill after radiation. Efforts to increase oxygen delivery to the tumor have not shown positive clinical results. Here we show that targeting mitochondrial respiration results in a significant reduction of the tumor cells' demand for oxygen, leading to increased tumor oxygenation and radiation response. We identified an activity of the FDA-approved drug papaverine as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I. We also provide genetic evidence that papaverine's complex I inhibition is directly responsible for increased oxygenation and enhanced radiation response. Furthermore, we describe derivatives of papaverine that have the potential to become clinical radiosensitizers with potentially fewer side effects. Importantly, this radiosensitizing strategy will not sensitize well-oxygenated normal tissue, thereby increasing the therapeutic index of radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is frequent after joint arthroplasty; in addition to causing patient distress, it interferes with early mobilization and hospital discharge. Various antiemetic agents reduce PONV, but their action is limited by a short half-life. Aprepitant, an antiemetic developed for patients receiving chemotherapy, has a duration of action much longer than other antiemetics. Questions/purposes: We asked whether a single dose of preoperative aprepitant (40 mg orally) reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting after THA or TKA. Methods: Fifty patients who received a preoperative dose of aprepitant (study group) were matched demographically to 50 patients who did not receive aprepitant (control group) from a group of patients undergoing THA or TKA. Patients' charts were reviewed to identify episodes of PONV, number of doses of antiemetics needed for breakthrough PONV, and length of stay. Aprepitant side effects, and complications. Results: Aprepitant reduced the percentage of patients with PONV (39{\%} of study and 70{\%} of control patients). Moderate or severe PONV occurred in 22{\%} of study and 40{\%} of control patients. The number of episodes of PONV during hospitalization was 2.9 for the control group and 1.6 for the study group. Postoperatively, the control group required on average 1.3 doses of ondansetron compared with 0.6 doses for the study group. Hospital length of stay was reduced from 3.3 days for the control group and to 2.3 days for the study group. Conclusions: These data suggest a single preoperative dose of aprepitant reduces the number of episodes and severity of PONV, the need for additional antiemetics, and the length of stay.

abstract = {Purpose: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is the most effective therapy for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Recently to calculate the risks of recurrence and progression based on data from 7 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer trials a scoring system was reported. However, in that series only 171 patients were treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We developed a risk stratification model to provide accurate estimates of recurrence and progression probability after bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Materials and Methods: Data were analyzed on 1,062 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and included in 4 Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment trials. Stepwise multivariate Cox models were used to determine the effect of prognostic factors. In each patient the weight of all factors was summed to a total score. Patients were then divided into groups, and cumulative recurrence and progression rates were calculated. Results: A scoring system was calculated with a score of 0 to 16 for recurrence and 0 to 14 for progression. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by score, and recurrence and progression probabilities were calculated in each group. For recurrence the variables were gender, age, grade, tumor status, multiplicity and associated Tis. For progression the variables were age, grade, tumor status, T category, multiplicity and associated Tis. For recurrence calculated risks using Spanish Urological Club for Oncological Treatment tables were lower than those obtained with Sylvester tables. For progression probabilities were lower in our model only in patients with high risk tumors. Conclusions: We propose a scoring model to stratify the risk of recurrence and progression in patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {Context The European Association of Urology (EAU) panel on Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) released an updated version of the guidelines on Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer. Objective To present the 2016 EAU guidelines on NMIBC. Evidence acquisition A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the NMIBC guidelines published between April 1, 2014, and May 31, 2015, was performed. Databases covered by the search included Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Libraries. Previous guidelines were updated, and levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were assigned. Evidence synthesis Tumours staged as TaT1 or carcinoma in situ (CIS) are grouped as NMIBC. Diagnosis depends on cystoscopy and histologic evaluation of the tissue obtained by transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) in papillary tumours or by multiple bladder biopsies in CIS. In papillary lesions, a complete TURB is essential for the patient's prognosis. If the initial resection is incomplete, there is no muscle in the specimen, or a high-grade or T1 tumour is detected, a second TURB should be performed within 2–6 wk. The risks of both recurrence and progression may be estimated for individual patients using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring system and risk tables. The stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups is pivotal to recommending adjuvant treatment. For patients with a low-risk tumour and intermediate-risk patients at a lower risk of recurrence, one immediate instillation of chemotherapy is recommended. Patients with an intermediate-risk tumour should receive 1 yr of full-dose bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy or instillations of chemotherapy for a maximum of 1 yr. In patients with high-risk tumours, full-dose intravesical BCG for 1–3 yr is indicated. In patients at highest risk of tumour progression, immediate radical cystectomy (RC) should be considered. RC is recommended in BCG-refractory tumours. The long version of the guidelines is available at the EAU Web site (www.uroweb.org/guidelines). Conclusions These abridged EAU guidelines present updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of NMIBC for incorporation into clinical practice. Patient summary The European Association of Urology has released updated guidelines on Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). Stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups is essential for decisions about adjuvant intravesical instillations. Risk tables can be used to estimate risks of recurrence and progression. Radical cystectomy should be considered only in case of failure of instillations or in NMIBC with the highest risk of progression.},

Methods: A combined analysis was carried out of individual patient data from 2596 superficial bladder cancer patients included in seven European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trials. Results: A simple scoring system was derived based on six clinical and pathological factors: number of tumors, tumor size, prior recurrence rate, T category, carcinoma in situ, and grade. The probabilities of recurrence and progression at one year ranged from 15{\%} to 61{\%} and from less than 1{\%} to 17{\%}, respectively. At five years, the probabilities of recurrence and progression ranged from 31{\%} to 78{\%} and from less than 1{\%} to 45{\%}.

The main presenting symptom of all bladder cancers is painless haematuria, and the diagnosis is established by urinary cytology and transurethral tumour resection. Intravesical treatment is used for carcinoma in situ and other high grade non-muscle-invasive tumours. The standard of care for muscle-invasive disease is radical cystoprostatectomy, and several types of urinary diversions are offered to patients, with quality of life as an important consideration. Bladder preservation with transurethral tumour resection, rad iation, and chemotherapy can in some cases be equally curative. Several chemotherapeutic agents have proven to be useful as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment and in patients with metastatic disease.

abstract = {Ovarian cancer (OC) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the world and the tenth most common in China. Epithelial OC is the most predominant pathologic subtype, with five major histotypes that differ in origination, pathogenesis, molecular alterations, risk factors, and prognosis. Genetic susceptibility is manifested by rare inherited mutations with high to moderate penetrance. Genome-wide association studies have additionally identified 29 common susceptibility alleles for OC, including 14 subtype-specific alleles. Several reproductive and hormonal factors may lower risk, including parity, oral contraceptive use, and lactation, while others such as older age at menopause and hormone replacement therapy confer increased risks. These associations differ by histotype, especially for mucinous OC, likely reflecting differences in etiology. Endometrioid and clear cell OC share a similar, unique pattern of associations with increased risks among women with endometriosis and decreased risks associated with tubal ligation. OC risks associated with other gynecological conditions and procedures, such as hysterectomy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and polycystic ovarian syndrome, are less clear. Other possible risk factors include environmental and lifestyle factors such as asbestos and talc powder exposures, and cigarette smoking. The epidemiology provides clues on etiology, primary prevention, early detection, and possibly even therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Previous studies have observed that tubal ligation and hysterectomy are associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer; however, little is known about whether these associations vary by surgical characteristics, individual characteristics or tumor histology. We used logistic regression to examine tubal ligation, simple hysterectomy and hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy in relation to risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in the New England Case-Control Study. Our primary analysis included 2,265 cases and 2,333 controls. Overall, tubal ligation was associated with a lower risk of epithelial ovarian cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.97], especially for endometrioid tumors (OR = 0.45, 95{\%} CI: 0.29-0.69). The inverse association between tubal ligation and ovarian cancer risk was stronger for women who had undergone the procedure at the time of last delivery (OR = 0.60, 95{\%} CI: 0.42-0.84) rather than at a later time (OR = 0.93, 95{\%} CI: 0.75-1.15). Overall, simple hysterectomy was not associated with ovarian cancer risk (OR: 1.09, 95{\%} CI: 0.83-1.42), although it was associated with a nonsignificant decreased risk of ovarian cancer among women who underwent the procedure at age 45 or older (RR: 0.64, 95{\%} CI: 0.40-1.02) or within the last 10 years (OR = 0.65, 95{\%} CI: 0.38-1.13). Overall, women who had a hysterectomy with a unilateral oophorectomy had significantly lower risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 0.65, 95{\%} CI: 0.45-0.94). In summary, tubal ligation and hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy were inversely associated with ovarian cancer risk in a large population-based case-control study. Additional research is necessary to understand the potential biologic mechanisms by which these procedures may reduce ovarian cancer risk. What's new? Tubal ligation and hysterectomy are generally known to lower ovarian cancer risk. However, little is known whether this risk reduction is influenced by the details of the surgical procedures or by the tumor histology. In this large case-control study, the authors show that tubal ligation was associated with a 18{\%} reduced risk in ovarian cancer with strongest effects in endometrioid tumors and among women who underwent the procedure after the last childbirth. No overall association with simple hysterectomy was observed but hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy lowered the risk by 35{\%}, underscoring the benefit of the procedure in the prevention of ovarian cancer.

abstract = {Objectives: To test if anesthetic selection alters serum miRNA profiles during primary cytoreductive surgery for suspected ovarian cancer. Method(s): This was a prospective phase 0 study of women with a new diagnosis of a pelvic mass and suspected ovarian cancer undergoing exploratory laparotomy and primary cytoreduction. Serum samples were drawn preoperatively, postoperative day 1, and postoperative day 3. miRNA was isolated directly from serum using Trizol preps. Sixtyeight microRNA targets were examined simultaneously from each sample in duplicate using the Firefly miRNA assay and normalized to let7i-5p, let7g-5p, and let7d-5p expression. A selection of patient samples were also run on Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) cards for validation. SerummiRNA expression levels were compared according to anesthetic regimen. P {\textless} 0.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-one patients received general anesthesia and epidural analgesia, and 12 patients received general anesthesia alone. Six patients were diagnosed with benign disease, 3 had borderline tumors, 9 had early-stage ovarian cancer, and 15 had advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Three patients had nonovarian malignancies. Among 167 serum samples across 33 patients, we detected an average of 36 miRNA targets (with 18 detected in each of the 167 samples). For a selection of six patients, serummiRNA profiles were compared to TLDA cards, and for the 63 miRNAs with overlap, there was good correlation, with an average Pearson correlation of 62{\%}. Compared to general anesthesia alone, addition of regional analgesia was associated with altered expression of eight miRNAs: mir202-3p, mir98-5p, mir92b-3p, mir15b-5p, let7b-5p, mir20a-5p, mir183-5p, and let-7e-5p. Expression of the leading target, mir202-3p, a potent tumor suppressor, was much higher in patients receiving epidural analgesia. Conclusion(s): The Firefly miRNA platform offers reliable and highly multiplexed analysis of serum miRNA. Use of epidural analgesia does alter miRNA profiles, and its effects on mir202-3p, in particular, may explain our previous observation that use of epidural analgesia is associated with a lower rate of ovarian cancer recurrence after primary cytoreductive surgery.},

A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is demonstrated that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals to unity (as well as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals to two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

abstract = {Although advances in information technology in the past decade have come in quantum leaps in nearly every aspect of our lives, they seem to be coming at a slower pace in the field of medicine. However, the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals is increasing rapidly, accelerated by the meaningful use initiatives associated with the Center for Medicare {\&} Medicaid Services EHR Incentive Programs. The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting "alert fatigue" and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of "big data" in health care provide the potential not only to perform "in silico" research but also to provide "real time" diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. "On demand" access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy! Challenge, which pitted the best all-time human players against the Watson computer, captured the imagination of millions of people across the world and demonstrated the potential to apply AI approaches to a wide variety of subject matter, including medicine. The combination of AI, big data, and massively parallel computing offers the potential to create a revolutionary way of practicing evidence-based, personalized medicine. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (≥ 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

Following its discovery in the blood of some patients with specifi c types of cancers or other benign conditions, CA125 has found application as a tumor marker of ovarian cancer. Thirty years after its discovery, use of CA 125 is still FDA-recommended to monitor response to therapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and to detect residual or recurrent disease in patients who have undergone fi rst-line therapy and would be considered for second-look procedures. However, due to its limited specifi city and sensitivity, CA 125 alone cannot still be an ideal biomarker. Increased clinical performance, in terms of better sensitivity and specifi city in identifying epithelial ovarian cancer relapse, has been obtained by combined use of CA 125 with HE4, another ovarian cancer marker recently introduced in clinical use. Signifi cant advancements have been achieved more recently, due to the introduction of FDA-approved ROMA and OVA1 algorithms to evaluate the risk of ovarian cancer for patients with a pelvic mass.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the prediction accuracy of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Spanish Urology Association for Oncological Treatment (CUETO) risk tables in all non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Material and Methods: Recurrence and progression-free survival of all patients were assessed according to the EORTC and the CUETO risk tables for each patient and the concordance index was used to indicate discriminative ability. Statistical analyses were performed, at 1 and 5 years, to the whole group and separately to those treated or not treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Results: The study included 400 patients. One-year BCG maintenance therapy was applied to 181 patients (45.3{\%}). The recurrence rate was higher than in CUETO, and similar to EORTC. The EORTC was determined to provide better discrimination than CUETO in the whole patient group and in those treated or not treated with BCG. The concordance indices for these groups were 0.777, 0.705; 0.773, 0.669; and 0.823, 0.758, respectively . The progression rate was similar in this study to the rate defined in both risk tables. The discrimination power was similar in EORTC and CUETO for all the groups. The concordance indices were 0.801, 0.881; 0.915, 0.930; and 0.832, 0.806, respectively. Conclusion: The EORTC has more power than CUETO to discriminate each recurrence risk group and both risk tables can successfully discriminate progression risk groups in all patients.},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed ∼140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

Specific genetic alterations have been described in PA, but the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We studied microRNA (miRNA) alterations in a large cohort of patients with PA. A total of 43 PA, including 35 sporadic grade I PA, 4 neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated PA, and 4 PA with pilomyxoid features, as well as 5 nonneoplastic brain controls were examined. BRAF fusion status was assessed in most cases. RNA was examined using the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V3 platform. Expression of miRNA subsets was validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with Taqman probes. Validation of predicted protein targets was performed on tissue microarrays with the use of immunohistochemistry. We identified a subset of miRNAs that were differentially expressed in pediatric PAs versus normal brain tissue: 13 miRNAs were underexpressed, and 20 miRNAs were overexpressed in tumors. Differences were validated by qRT-PCR in a subset, with mean fold change in tumor versus brain of-17 (miR-124),-15 (miR-129), and 19.8 (miR-21). Searching for predicted protein targets in Targetscan, we identified a number of known and putative oncogenes that were predicted targets of miRNA sets relatively underexpressed in PA. Predicted targets with increased expression at the mRNA and/or protein level in PA included PBX3, METAP2, and NFIB. A unique miRNA profile exists in PA, compared with brain tissue. These miRNAs and their targets may play a role in the pathogenesis of PA. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

We found 81 miRNAs for pancreatic cancer and 66 miRNAs for biliary-tract cancer that showed statistically different expression compared with healthy controls. Among those markers, 55 miRNAs were common in both the pancreatic and biliary-tract cancer samples. The previously reported miR-125a-3p was one of the common markers; however, it was also expressed in other types of digestive-tract cancers, suggesting that it is not specific to cancer types. In order to discriminate the pancreato-biliary cancers from all other clinical conditions including the healthy controls, non-malignant abnormalities, and other types of cancers, we developed a diagnostic index using expression profiles of the 10 most significant miRNAs. A combination of eight miRNAs (miR-6075, miR-4294, miR-6880-5p, miR-6799-5p, miR-125a-3p, miR-4530, miR-6836-3p, and miR-4476) achieved a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC of 80.3{\%}, 97.6{\%}, 91.6{\%}and 0.953, respectively. In contrast, CA19-9 and CEA gave sensitivities of 65.6{\%}and 40.0{\%}, specificities of 92.9{\%} and 88.6{\%}, and accuracies of 82.1{\%} and 71.8{\%}, respectively, in the same test cohort. This diagnostic index identified 18/21 operable pancreatic cancers and 38/48 operable biliary-tract cancers in the entire cohort. Our results suggest that the assessment of these miRNA markers is clinically valuable to identify patients with pancreato-biliary cancers who could benefit from surgical intervention.},

The diagnostic value of several miRNAs was appraised in pediatric dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) using miRNA microarrays and receiving operating characteristic curves analyses. Overall, five pediatric DNETs were studied. As controls, 17 samples were used: the FirstChoice Human Brain Reference RNA and 16 samples from deceased children who underwent autopsy and were not present with any brain malignancy. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the mirVANA miRNA Isolation Kit, while the experimental approach included miRNA microarrays covering 1211 miRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate the expression profiles of miR-1909* and miR-3138 in all samples initially screened with miRNA microarrays. Our findings indicated that miR-3138 might act as a tumor suppressor gene when down-regulated and miR-1909* as a putative oncogenic molecule when up-regulated in pediatric DNETs compared to the control cohort. Subsequently, both miRNA signatures might serve as putative diagnostic biomarkers for pediatric DNETs.},

abstract = {Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNET) are considered to be rare, benign, and associated with chronic epilepsy. We present the case of a 28-year-old man with a history of epilepsy since age 12. Surgery of an occipital cortical lesion in 2009 revealed a DNET. Five years later, a recurrent tumor at the edge of the resection cavity was removed, and the tissue underwent an intensive diagnostic workup. The first tumor was unequivocally characterized as a DNET, but neuropathological diagnostics of the recurrent tumor revealed a glioblastoma. After 6 months, another recurrent tumor was detected next to the location of the original tumor, and this was also resected. An Illumina 450 K beadchip methylation array was performed to characterize all of the tumors. The methylation profile of these tumors significantly differed from other glioblastoma and epilepsy-associated tumor profiles and revealed a DNET-like methylation profile. Thus, molecular characterization of these recurrent tumors suggests malignant transformation of a previously benign DNET. We found increased copy number changes in the recurrent DNET tumors after malignant transformation. Modern high-throughput analysis adds essential molecular information in addition to standard histopathology for proper identification of rare brain tumors that present with an unusual clinical course.},

abstract = {Astroblastoma is a rare and controversial glioma with variable clinical behavior. The diagnosis currently rests on histologic findings of a circumscribed glioma with astroblastomatous pseudorosettes and vascular hyalinization. Immunohistochemical studies have suggested different oncogenic drivers, such as BRAF p.V600E, but very few cases have been studied using genome-wide methodologies. Recent genomic profiling identified a subset of CNS embryonal tumors with astroblastoma-like morphology that harbored MN1 gene fusions, termed “CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumors with MN1 alteration” (CNS-HGNET-MN1). To further characterize the genetic alterations that drive astroblastomas, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 500 cancer-associated genes in a series of eight cases. We correlated these findings with break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the MN1 locus and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Four cases showed MN1 alteration by FISH, including two pediatric cases that lacked other pathogenic alterations, and two adult cases that harbored other cancer-associated gene mutations or copy number alterations (eg, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, TP53, ATM and TERT promoter mutations). Three of these cases grouped with the CNS-HGNET-MN1 entity by methylation profiling. Two of four MN1 intact cases by FISH showed genetic features of either anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (BRAF p.V600E mutation, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion and TERT promoter mutation) or IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (trisomy 7, monosomy 10, CDK4 amplification and TP53, NRAS and TERT promoter mutations) and these cases had an aggressive clinical course. Two clinically indolent cases remained unclassifiable despite multimodal molecular analysis. We conclude that astroblastoma histology is not specific for any entity including CNS-HGNET-MN1, and that additional genetic characterization should be considered for astroblastomas, as a number of these tumors likely contain a methylation profile or genetic alterations that suggest classification as other tumor entities. Our heterogeneous molecular findings help to explain the clinical unpredictability of astroblastoma.},

The pathological spectrum includes gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs), diffuse astrocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs), among others. Clinically, hemispheric PLGGs represent a well-recognized cause of intractable epilepsy in children and adolescents. With an excellent long-term outcome, surgery remains the cornerstone and patients with gross total resection typically do not need any further therapies. The recent literature about hemispheric PLGGs was reviewed to provide an up-to-date overview of the molecular and cell biology of these tumors. Hemispheric PLGGs can harbor multiple alterations involving BRAFV600E, FGFR, NTRK, MYB/MYBL1, IDH, and BRAF-KIAA1549 fusions. However, the clinical significance of most of these alterations is still to be defined. The role of RAS/MAPK mutations and other alterations in hemispheric PLGGs is of interest from diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic perspectives. Molecular testing for these tumors should be encouraged, since the findings can have an important impact not only in prognosis but also in therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Background: Gangliogliomas are low-grade glioneuronal tumors of the central nervous system and the commonest cause of chronic intractable epilepsy. Most gangliogliomas ({\textgreater}70{\%}) arise in the temporal lobe, and infratentorial tumors account for less than 10{\%}. Posterior fossa gangliogliomas can have the features of a classic supratentorial tumor or a pilocytic astrocytoma with focal gangliocytic differentiation, and this observation led to the hypothesis tested in this study - gangliogliomas of the posterior fossa and spinal cord consist of two morphologic types that can be distinguished by specific genetic alterations. Results: Histological review of 27 pediatric gangliogliomas from the posterior fossa and spinal cord indicated that they could be readily placed into two groups: classic gangliogliomas (group I; n=16) and tumors that appeared largely as a pilocytic astrocytoma, but with foci of gangliocytic differentiation (group II; n=11). Detailed radiological review, which was blind to morphologic assignment, identified a triad of features, hemorrhage, midline location, and the presence of cysts or necrosis, that distinguished the two morphological groups with a sensitivity of 91{\%} and specificity of 100{\%}. Molecular genetic analysis revealed BRAF duplication and a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene in 82{\%} of group II tumors, but in none of the group I tumors, and a BRAF:p. V600E mutation in 43{\%} of group I tumors, but in none of the group II tumors. Conclusions: Our study provides support for a classification that would divide infratentorial gangliogliomas into two categories, (classic) gangliogliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas with gangliocytic differentiation, which have distinct morphological, radiological, and molecular characteristics.},

abstract = {The 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System is both a conceptual and practical advance over its 2007 predecessor. For the first time, the WHO classification of CNS tumors uses molecular parameters in addition to histology to define many tumor entities, thus formulating a concept for how CNS tumor diagnoses should be structured in the molecular era. As such, the 2016 CNS WHO presents major restructuring of the diffuse gliomas, medulloblastomas and other embryonal tumors, and incorporates new entities that are defined by both histology and molecular features, including glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype and glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M–mutant; RELA fusion–positive ependymoma; medulloblastoma, WNT-activated and medulloblastoma, SHH-activated; and embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes, C19MC-altered. The 2016 edition has added newly recognized neoplasms, and has deleted some entities, variants and patterns that no longer have diagnostic and/or biological relevance. Other notable changes include the addition of brain invasion as a criterion for atypical meningioma and the introduction of a soft tissue-type grading system for the now combined entity of solitary fibrous tumor / hemangiopericytoma—a departure from the manner by which other CNS tumors are graded. Overall, it is hoped that the 2016 CNS WHO will facilitate clinical, experimental and epidemiological studies that will lead to improvements in the lives of patients with brain tumors.},

To better define the diagnostic potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) for CRC, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of reported circulating CRC miRNA markers. After a systematic literature review, we selected 30 candidate miRNAs and used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to examine their expression in a training cohort of 120 plasma samples (CRC vs healthy controls (HC) = 60:60). Expression data was confirmed in a validation cohort of 160 plasma samples (CRC vs HC = 80:80). We ultimately identified 5 dysregulated circulating miRNAs (miR-15b, miR-17, miR-21, miR-26b, and miR-145), of which miR-21 and miR-26b proved to have the best diagnostic performance in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Based on these results, we propose a novel blood-based diagnostic model, integrating 5 CRC-related miRNAs and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which provides better diagnostic performance than the combined 5 miRNAs, CEA alone, or any single miRNA. We propose that the novel CRC diagnostic model presented here will be useful for overcoming the limitations faced by current non-invasive diagnostic strategies.},

Particular focus has been placed on the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to enable efficient patient management — from early detection of cancer to monitoring for disease recurrence or progression after treatment. Owing to their high abundance and stability, circulating ncRNAs have potential utility as non-invasive, blood-based biomarkers that can provide information on tumour biology and the effects of treatments, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Increasing evidence highlights the roles of ncRNAs in cell-to-cell communication, with a number of ncRNAs having the capacity to regulate gene expression outside of the cell of origin through extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer to recipient cells, with implications for cancer progression and therapy resistance. Moreover, ‘foreign' microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by non-human genomes (so-called xeno-miRNAs), such as viral miRNAs, have been shown to be present in human body fluids and can be used as biomarkers. Herein, we review the latest developments in the use of circulating ncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and discuss their roles in cell-to-cell communication in the context of cancer. We provide a compendium of miRNAs and long ncRNAs that have been reported in the literature to be present in human body fluids and that have the potential to be used as diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers.},

We measured an identical set of 20 standardized positive and negative control samples, including human universal reference rnA, human brain rnA and titrations thereof, human serum samples and synthetic spikes from micrornA family members with varying homology.

abstract = {Since September 11, 2001, there has been the recognition of a plausible threat from acts of terrorism, including radiological or nuclear attacks. A network of Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCRs) has been established across the U.S.; one of the missions of this network is to identify and develop mitigating agents that can be used to treat the civilian population after a radiological event. The development of such agents requires comparison of data from many sources and accumulation of information consistent with the "Animal Rule" from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Given the necessity for a consensus on appropriate animal model use across the network to allow for comparative studies to be performed across institutions, and to identify pivotal studies and facilitate FDA approval, in early 2008, investigators from each of the CMCRs organized and met for an Animal Models Workshop. Working groups deliberated and discussed the wide range of animal models available for assessing agent efficacy in a number of relevant tissues and organs, including the immune and hematopoietic systems, gastrointestinal tract, lung, kidney and skin. Discussions covered the most appropriate species and strains available as well as other factors that may affect differential findings between groups and institutions. This report provides the workshop findings. {\textcopyright} by Radiation Research Society.},

abstract = {The acute radiation syndrome (ARS) occurs after whole-body or significant partial-body irradiation (typically at a dose of {\textgreater}1. Gy). ARS can involve the hematopoietic, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and the neurovascular organ systems either individually or in combination.There is a correlation between the severity of clinical signs and symptoms of ARS and radiation dose. Radiation induced multi-organ failure (MOF) describes the progressive dysfunction of two or more organ systems over time. Radiation combined injury (RCI) is defined as radiation injury combined with blunt or penetrating trauma, burns, blast, or infection. The classic syndromes are: hematopoietic (doses {\textgreater}2-3. Gy), gastrointestinal (doses 5-12. Gy) and cerebrovascular syndrome (doses 10-20. Gy). There is no possibility to survive after doses {\textgreater}10-12. Gy.The Phases of ARS are-prodromal: 0-2 days from exposure, latent: 2-20 days, and manifest illness: 21-60 days from exposure.Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at a dose of 5$\mu$g/kg body weight per day subcutaneously has been recommended as treatment of neutropenia, and antibiotics, antiviral and antifungal agents for prevention or treatment of infections.If taken within the first hours of contamination, stable iodine in the form of nonradioactive potassium iodide (KI) saturates iodine binding sites within the thyroid and inhibits incorporation of radioiodines into the gland.Finally, if severe aplasia persists under cytokines for more than 14 days, the possibility of a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation should be evaluated.This review will focus on the clinical aspects of the ARS, using the European triage system (METREPOL) to evaluate the severity of radiation injury, and scoring groups of patients for the general and specific management of the syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2011 Greater Poland Cancer Centre, Poland.},

abstract = {The hazard of ionizing radiation exposure due to nuclear accidents or terrorist attacks is ever increasing. Despite decades of research, still, there is a shortage of non-toxic, safe and effective medical countermeasures for radiological and nuclear emergency. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved only two growth factors, Neupogen (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), filgrastim) and Neulasta (PEGylated G-CSF, pegfilgrastim) for the treatment of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) following the Animal Efficacy Rule. Promising radioprotective efficacy results of $\gamma$-tocotrienol (GT3; a member of the vitamin E family) in the mouse model encouraged its further evaluation in the nonhuman primate (NHP) model. These studies demonstrated that GT3 significantly aided the recovery of radiation-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared to the vehicle controls; these results particularly significant after exposure to 5.8 or 6.5 Gray (Gy) whole body $\gamma$-irradiation. The stimulatory effect of GT3 on neutrophils and thrombocytes (platelets) was directly and positively correlated with dose; a 75 mg/kg dose was more effective compared to 37.5 mg/kg. GT3 was also effective against 6.5 Gy whole body $\gamma$-irradiation for improving neutrophils and thrombocytes. Moreover, a single administration of GT3 without any supportive care was equivalent, in terms of improving hematopoietic recovery, to multiple doses of Neupogen and two doses of Neulasta with full supportive care (including blood products) in the NHP model. GT3 may serve as an ultimate radioprotector for use in humans, particularly for military personnel and first responders. In brief, GT3 is a promising radiation countermeasure that ought to be further developed for U.S. FDA approval for the ARS indication.},

Inasmuch as exposing healthy human volunteers to injurious levels of radiation is unethical, development and approval of new radiation countermeasures for ARS are therefore presently based on animal studies and Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers. The Animal Efficacy Rule, which underlies the Food and Drug Administration approval pathway, requires a sound understanding of the mechanisms of injury, drug efficacy, and efficacy biomarkers. In this context, it is important to identify biomarkers for radiation injury and drug efficacy that can extrapolate animal efficacy results, and can be used to convert drug doses deduced from animal studies to those that can be efficacious when used in humans. Here, we summarize the progress of studies to identify candidate biomarkers for the extent of radiation injury and for evaluation of countermeasure efficacy.},

An increased probability of radiological or nuclear incidents due to detonation of nuclear weapons by terrorists, sabotage of nuclear facilities, dispersal and exposure to radioactive materials, and accidents provides the basis for such enhanced radiation exposure risks for civilian populations. Although the search for suitable radiation countermeasures for radiation-associated injuries was initiated more than half a century ago, no safe and effective radiation countermeasure for the most severe of these injuries, namely acute radiation syndrome (ARS), has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (≈22 nt) regulatory RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. We show here that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. miRNAs originating from human prostate cancer xenografts enter the circulation, are readily measured in plasma, and can robustly distinguish xenografted mice from controls. This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of miR-141 (a miRNA expressed in prostate cancer) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls. Our results establish the measurement of tumor-derived miRNAs in serum or plasma as an important approach for the blood-based detection of human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Background and aim The potential of microRNAs (miRNA) as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets, has recently been recognized. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of consistency in the methodology used, but to our knowledge, no study has described the methodology of sample preparation and storage systematically with respect to miRNAs as blood biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the stability of miRNAs in blood under various relevant clinical and research conditions: Different collection tubes, storage at different temperatures, physical disturbance, as well as serial freeze-Thaw cycles. Methods Blood samples were collected from 12 healthy donors into different collection tubes containing anticoagulants, including EDTA, citrate and lithium-heparin, as well as into serum collection tubes. MiRNA stability was evaluated by measuring expression changes of miR-1, miR- 21 and miR-29b at different conditions: varying processing time of whole blood (up to 72 hours (h)), long-Term storage (9 months at -80C), physical disturbance (1 and 8 h), as well as in a series of freeze/thaw cycles (1 and 4 times). Results Different collection tubes revealed comparable concentrations of miR-1, miR-21 and miR- 29b. Tubes with lithium-heparin were found unsuitable for miRNA quantification. MiRNA levels were stable for at least 24 h at room temperature in whole blood, while separated fractions did show alterations within 24 h. There were significant changes in the miR-21 and miR-29b levels after 72 h incubation of whole blood at room temperature (p{\textless}0.01 for both). Both miR-1 and miR-21 showed decreased levels after physical disturbance for 8 h in separated plasma and miR-1 in serum whole blood, while after 1 h of disturbance no changes were observed. Storage of samples at -80{\^{E}}C extended the miRNA stability remarkably, however, miRNA levels in long-Term stored (9 months) whole blood samples were significantly changed, which is in contrast to the plasma samples, where miR-21 or miR-29b levels were found to be stable. Repetitive (n = 4) freeze-Thaw cycles resulted in a significant reduction of miRNA concentration both in plasma and serum samples. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of proper and systematic sample collection and preparation when measuring circulating miRNAs, e.g., in context of clinical trials. We demonstrated that the type of collection tubes, preparation, handling and storage of samples should be standardized to avoid confounding variables influencing the results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Early and specific detection of cancer is of great importance for successful treatment of the disease. New biomarkers, such as microRNAs, could improve treatment efficiency and survival ratio. In human medicine, deregulation of microRNA profiles in circulation has shown great potential as a new type of biomarker for cancer diagnostics. There are, however, few studies of circulating microRNAs in dogs. Extracellular circulating microRNAs have shown a high level of stability in human blood and other body fluids. Nevertheless, there are still important issues to be solved before microRNAs can be applied routinely as a clinical tool, one of them being their stability over time in media commonly used for blood sampling. OBJECTIVE Evaluation of the stability of microRNA levels in plasma and serum from healthy dogs after storage at room temperature for different time points before being processed. METHODS The levels of four microRNAs (cfa-let-7a, cfa-miR-16, cfa-miR-23a and cfa-miR-26a) known to be stably expressed from other canine studies, have been measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). RESULTS MicroRNA levels were found sufficiently stable for gene profiling in serum- and plasma stored at room temperature for 1 hour but not for samples stored at room temperature for 24 hours. CONCLUSION Storage at room temperature of serum and plasma samples intended for microRNA profiling should be kept for a minimum period of time before proceeding with RNA isolation. For the four microRNAs investigated in the present study, we did not find significant differences in microRNA levels between serum and plasma samples from the same time point.},

abstract = {In biospectroscopy, suitably annotated and statistically independent samples (e.g. patients, batches, etc.) for classifier training and testing are scarce and costly. Learning curves show the model performance as function of the training sample size and can help to determine the sample size needed to train good classifiers. However, building a good model is actually not enough: the performance must also be proven. We discuss learning curves for typical small sample size situations with 5-25 independent samples per class. Although the classification models achieve acceptable performance, the learning curve can be completely masked by the random testing uncertainty due to the equally limited test sample size. In consequence, we determine test sample sizes necessary to achieve reasonable precision in the validation and find that 75-100 samples will usually be needed to test a good but not perfect classifier. Such a data set will then allow refined sample size planning on the basis of the achieved performance. We also demonstrate how to calculate necessary sample sizes in order to show the superiority of one classifier over another: this often requires hundreds of statistically independent test samples or is even theoretically impossible. We demonstrate our findings with a data set of ca. 2550 Raman spectra of single cells (five classes: erythrocytes, leukocytes and three tumour cell lines BT-20, MCF-7 and OCI-AML3) as well as by an extensive simulation that allows precise determination of the actual performance of the models in question. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. Methods. We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method. Results: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Figueroa et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The prevalence of MD was stable at between 4.2 and 4.6/100,000 children, accounting for 3.1-4.2{\%} of children with diabetes, with glucokinase (GCK)-MODY being the most frequent type, amounting to 83{\%} of patients with MD. The percentage of positive test results decreased with the number of referrals, suggesting that children with the highest probability of MD were referred initially, followed by those with a less clear-cut phenotype. The prevalence of neonatal diabetes equalled 1 in 300,000 children. Conclusions/interpretation: The prevalence of MD in a paediatric population with a low prevalence of obesity remains stable and is nearly fivefold higher than that of type 2 diabetes and CFRD, justifying a need for increased access to genetic diagnostic procedures in diabetic children. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE-Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene, encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channel, result in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. They also may cause neurologic symptoms such as mental retardation and motor problems (iDEND syndrome) and epilepsy (DEND syndrome). Sulphonylurea (SU) treatment is reported to alleviate both the neurologic symptoms and diabetes in such cases. The study aimed to establish the magnitude and functional basis of the effect of SUs on the neurologic phenotype in children with iDEND using neuroimaging before and after insulin replacement with glibenclamide. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS-To localize and quantify the effect of glibenclamide administration, we performed single-photon emission computed tomography in seven patients with different mutations in KCNJ11. In five patients, measurements before and after initiation of SU treatment were performed. RESULTS-Significant changes in single-photon emission computed tomography signal intensity after transfer to SU therapy were restricted to the cerebellum, consistent with previous data showing high Kir6.2 expression in this brain region. Cerebellar perfusion improved for both left (P = 0.006) and right (P = 0.01) hemispheres, with themean improvement being 26.7±7.1{\%}(n=5).No patients showed deterioration of cerebellar perfusion on SU therapy. Electrophysiological studies revealed a good correlation between the magnitude of KATP channel dysfunction and the clinical phenotype; mutant channels with the greatest reduction in adenosine 5′-triphosphate inhibition were associated with the most severe neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS-We conclude it is likely that at least some of the beneficial effects of SU treatment on neurodevelopment in iDEND patients result from improved cerebellar perfusion. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract = {Patients with diabetes caused by single-gene mutations generally exhibit an altered course of diabetes. Those with mutations of the glucokinase gene (GCK-MODY) show good metabolic control and low risk of cardiovascular complications despite paradoxically lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In order to investigate the matter, we analyzed the composition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL subpopulations in such individuals. The LipoPrint{\textcopyright} system (Quantimetrix, USA) based on non-denaturing, linear polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate and measure LDL and HDL subclasses in fresh-frozen serum samples from patients with mutations of glucokinase or HNF1A, type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and healthy controls. Fresh serum samples from a total of 37 monogenic diabetes patients (21 from GCK-MODY and 16 from HNF1A-MODY), 22 T1DM patients and 15 healthy individuals were measured in this study. Concentrations of the small, highly atherogenic LDL subpopulation were similar among the compared groups. Large HDL percentage was significantly higher in GCK-MODY than in control (p = 0.0003), T1DM (p = 0.0006) and HNF1A-MODY groups (p = 0.0246). Patients with GCK-MODY were characterized by significantly lower intermediate HDL levels than controls (p = 0.0003) and T1DM (p = 0.0005). Small, potentially atherogenic HDL content differed significantly with the GCK-MODY group showing concentrations of that subfraction from control (p = 0.0096), T1DM (p = 0.0193) and HNF1A-MODY (p = 0.0057) groups. Within-group heterogeneity suggested the existence of potential gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. GCK-MODY is characterized by a strongly protective profile of HDL cholesterol subpopulations. A degree of heterogeneity within the groups suggests the existence of interactions with other genetic or clinical factors. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Extracellular vesicles are selectively enriched in RNA that has potential as disease biomarkers. To systemically characterize circulating extracellular RNA (exRNA) profiles, we performed RNA sequencing analysis on plasma extracellular vesicles derived from 50 healthy individuals and 142 cancer patients. Of ∼12.6 million raw reads for each individual, the number of mappable reads aligned to RNA references was ∼5.4 million including miRNAs (∼40.4{\%}), piwiRNAs (∼40.0{\%}), pseudo-genes (∼3.7{\%}), lncRNAs (∼2.4{\%}), tRNAs (∼2.1{\%}), and mRNAs (∼2.1{\%}). By expression stability testing, we identified a set of miRNAs showing relatively consistent expression, which may serve as reference control for exRNA quantification. By performing multivariate analysis of covariance, we identified significant associations of these exRNAs with age, sex and different types of cancers. In particular, down-regulation of miR-125a-5p and miR-1343-3p showed an association with all cancer types tested (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05). We developed multivariate statistical models to predict cancer status with an area under the curve from 0.68 to 0.92 depending cancer type and staging. This is the largest RNA-seq study to date for profiling exRNA species, which has not only provided a baseline reference profile for circulating exRNA, but also revealed a set of RNA candidates for reference controls and disease biomarkers.},

abstract = {Background: Molecular biomarkers that can predict drug efficacy in cancer patients are crucial components for the advancement of precision medicine. However, identifying these molecular biomarkers remains a laborious and challenging task. Next-generation sequencing of patients and preclinical models have increasingly led to the identification of novel gene-mutation-drug relations, and these results have been reported and published in the scientific literature. Results: Here, we present two new computational methods that utilize all the PubMed articles as domain specific background knowledge to assist in the extraction and curation of gene-mutation-drug relations from the literature. The first method uses the Biomedical Entity Search Tool (BEST) scoring results as some of the features to train the machine learning classifiers. The second method uses not only the BEST scoring results, but also word vectors in a deep convolutional neural network model that are constructed from and trained on numerous documents such as PubMed abstracts and Google News articles. Using the features obtained from both the BEST search engine scores and word vectors, we extract mutation-gene and mutation-drug relations from the literature using machine learning classifiers such as random forest and deep convolutional neural networks. Our methods achieved better results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We used our proposed features in a simple machine learning model, and obtained F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.82 for mutation-gene and mutation-drug relation classification, respectively. We also developed a deep learning classification model using convolutional neural networks, BEST scores, and the word embeddings that are pre-trained on PubMed or Google News data. Using deep learning, the classification accuracy improved, and F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.86 were obtained for the mutation-gene and mutation-drug relations, respectively. Conclusion: We believe that our computational methods described in this research could be used as an important tool in identifying molecular biomarkers that predict drug responses in cancer patients. We also built a database of these mutation-gene-drug relations that were extracted from all the PubMed abstracts. We believe that our database can prove to be a valuable resource for precision medicine researchers.},

Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play an important role in regulating various biological processes through their interaction with cellular messenger RNAs. Extracellular miRNAs in serum, plasma, saliva, and urine have recently been shown to be associated with various pathological conditions including cancer. METHODS: With the goal of assessing the distribution of miRNAs and demonstrating the potential use of miRNAs as biomarkers, we examined the presence of miRNAs in 12 human body fluids and urine samples from women in different stages of pregnancy or patients with different urothelial cancers. Using quantitative PCR, we conducted a global survey of the miRNA distribution in these fluids. RESULTS: miRNAs were present in all fluids tested and showed distinct compositions in different fluid types. Several of the highly abundant miRNAs in these fluids were common among multiple fluid types, and some of the miRNAs were enriched in specific fluids. We also observed distinct miRNA patterns in the urine samples obtained from individuals with different physiopathological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs are ubiquitous in all the body fluid types tested. Fluid type-specific miRNAs may have functional roles associated with the surrounding tissues. In addition, the changes in miRNA spectra observed in the urine samples from patients with different urothelial conditions demonstrates the potential for using concentrations of specific miRNAs in body fluids as biomarkers for detecting and monitoring various physiopathological conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.},

abstract = {Circulating microRNAs that are associated with specific diseases have garnered much attention for use in diagnostic assays. However, detection of disease-associated miRNA can be affected by several factors such as release of contaminating cellular miRNA during sample collection, variations due to amplification of transcript for detection, or controls used for normalization for accurate quantitation. We analyzed circulating miRNA in serum and plasma samples obtained concurrently from 28 patients, using a Nanostring quantitative assay platform. Total RNA concentration ranged from 32–125 $\mu$g/ml from serum and 30–220 $\mu$g/ml from plasma. Of 798 miRNAs, 371 miRNAs were not detected in either serum or plasma samples. 427 were detected in either serum or plasma but not both, whereas 151 miRNA were detected in both serum and plasma samples. The diversity of miRNA detected was greater in plasma than in serum samples. In serum samples, the number of detected miRNA ranged from 3 to 82 with a median of 17, whereas in plasma samples, the number of miRNA detected ranged from 25 to 221 with a median of 91. Several miRNA such as miR451a, miR 16-5p, miR-223-3p, and mir25-3p were highly abundant and differentially expressed between serum and plasma. The detection of endogenous and exogenous control miRNAs varied in serum and plasma, with higher levels observed in plasma. Gene expression stability identified candidate invariant microRNA that were highly stable across all samples, and could be used for normalization. In conclusion, there are significant differences in both the number of miRNA detected and the amount of miRNA detected between serum and plasma. Normalization using miRNA with constant expression is essential to minimize the impact of technical variations. Given the challenges involved, ideal candidates for blood based biomarkers would be those that are indifferent to type of body fluid, are detectable and can be reliably quantitated.},

abstract = {Background: AJCC staging of pancreatic cancer (PAC) is used to determine prognosis, yet survival within each stage shows wide variation and remains unpredictable. We hypothesized that tumor grade might be responsible for some of this variation and that the addition of grade to current AJCC staging would provide improved prognostication. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1991-2005) was used to identify 8082 patients with resected PAC. The impact of grade on overall and stage-specific survival was assessed using Cox regression analysis. Variables in the model were age, sex, tumor size, lymph node status, and tumor grade. Results: For each AJCC stage, survival was significantly worse for high-grade versus low-grade tumors. On multivariate analysis, high tumor grade was an independent predictor of survival for the entire cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] 1.31-1.48) as well as for stage I (HR 1.28, 95{\%} CI 1.07-1.54), stage IIA (HR 1.43, 95{\%} CI 1.26-1.61), stage IIB (HR 1.38, 95{\%} CI 1.27-1.50), stage III (HR 1.28, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.59), and stage IV (HR 1.58, 95{\%} CI 1.21-2.05) patients. The addition of grade to staging results in a statistically significant survival discrimination between all stages. Conclusions: Tumor grade is an important prognostic variable of survival in PAC. We propose a novel staging system incorporating grade into current AJCC staging for pancreas cancer. The improved prognostication is more reflective of tumor biology and may impact therapy decisions and stratification of future clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Surgical Oncology.},

The framework consists of two methods of transfer of knowledge from source to target data: transfer of whole rules and transfer of rule structures. We evaluated the methods on three pairs of data sets: one genomic and two proteomic. We used standard measures of classification performance and three novel measures of amount of transfer. Preliminary evaluation shows that whole-rule transfer improves classification performance over using the target data alone, especially when there is more source data than target data.

With "3D-Gene", a highly sensitive microarray, we examined comprehensive miRNA expression profiles in 571 serum samples obtained from healthy patients, patients with pancreatic, biliary-tract, or other digestive cancers, and patients with non-malignant abnormalities in the pancreas or biliary tract. The samples were randomly divided into training and test cohorts, and candidate miRNA markers were independently evaluated. We found 81 miRNAs for pancreatic cancer and 66 miRNAs for biliary-tract cancer that showed statistically different expression compared with healthy controls. Among those markers, 55 miRNAs were common in both the pancreatic and biliary-tract cancer samples. The previously reported miR-125a-3p was one of the common markers; however, it was also expressed in other types of digestive-tract cancers, suggesting that it is not specific to cancer types. In order to discriminate the pancreato-biliary cancers from all other clinical conditions including the healthy controls, non-malignant abnormalities, and other types of cancers, we developed a diagnostic index using expression profiles of the 10 most significant miRNAs. A combination of eight miRNAs (miR-6075, miR-4294, miR-6880-5p, miR-6799-5p, miR-125a-3p, miR-4530, miR-6836-3p, and miR-4476) achieved a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC of 80.3{\%}, 97.6{\%}, 91.6{\%}and 0.953, respectively. In contrast, CA19-9 and CEA gave sensitivities of 65.6{\%}and 40.0{\%}, specificities of 92.9{\%} and 88.6{\%}, and accuracies of 82.1{\%} and 71.8{\%}, respectively, in the same test cohort. This diagnostic index identified 18/21 operable pancreatic cancers and 38/48 operable biliary-tract cancers in the entire cohort. Our results suggest that the assessment of these miRNA markers is clinically valuable to identify patients with pancreato-biliary cancers who could benefit from surgical intervention.},

abstract = {This study explored decreased tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) plasma levels in pancreatic cancer (PCA) patients to clarify their potential as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We used the microRNA array-based approach to select candidates by comparing plasma levels between PCA patients and healthy volunteers. Six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-107, miR-126, miR-451, miR-145, miR-491-5p, and miR-146b-5p) were selected. Small-and large-scale analyses using samples from 100 PCA patients and 80 healthy volunteers revealed that miR-107 was the most down-regulated miRNA in PCA patients compared with healthy volunteers (P {\textless} 0.0001; area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.851). A low miR-107 plasma level was significantly associated with advanced T stage, N stage, and liver metastasis and was an independent factor predicting poor prognosis in PCA patients (P = 0.0424; hazard ratio, 2.95). miR-107 overexpression in PCA cells induced G1/S arrest with the production of p21 and inhibited cell proliferation through the transcriptional regulation of Notch2. In vivo, the restoration and maintenance of the miR-107 plasma level significantly inhibited tumor progression in mice. Depletion of the tumor suppressor miR-107 in plasma relates to tumor progression and poor outcomes. The restoration of the plasma miR-107 level might be a novel anticancer treatment strategy for PCA.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify molecular markers of disease processes. This plethora of complex-omics data has simultaneously complicated the problem of extracting meaningful molecular signatures and opened up new opportunities for more sophisticated integrative and holistic approaches. In this era, effective integration of data-driven and knowledge-based approaches for biomarker identification has been recognised as key to improving the identification of high-performance biomarkers, and necessary for translational applications. Here, we have evaluated the role of circulating microRNA as a means of predicting the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. We have developed a multi-objective optimisation method that effectively integrates a data-driven approach with the knowledge obtained from the microRNA-mediated regulatory network to identify robust plasma microRNA signatures which are reliable in terms of predictive power as well as functional relevance. The proposed multi-objective framework has the capacity to adjust for conflicting biomarker objectives and to incorporate heterogeneous information facilitating systems approaches to biomarker discovery. We have found a prognostic signature of colorectal cancer comprising 11 circulating microRNAs. The identified signature predicts the patients' survival outcome and targets pathways underlying colorectal cancer progression. The altered expression of the identified microRNAs was confirmed in an independent public data set of plasma samples of patients in early stage vs advanced colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the generality of the proposed method was demonstrated across three publicly available miRNA data sets associated with biomarker studies in other diseases.},

abstract = {Identification of the associations between microRNA molecules and human diseases from large-scale heterogeneous biological data is an important step for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases in microRNA level. However, experimental verification of microRNA-disease associations is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional experimental methods, we presented a combinatorial prioritization algorithm to predict the microRNA-disease associations. Importantly, our method can be used to predict microRNAs (diseases) associated with the diseases (microRNAs) without the known associated microRNAs (diseases). The predictive performance of our proposed approach was evaluated and verified by the internal cross-validations and external independent validations based on standard association datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the impressive performance for predicting the microRNA-disease association with the Area Under receiver operation characteristic Curve (AUC), 86.93{\%}, which is indeed outperform the previous prediction methods. Particularly, we observed that the ensemble-based method by integrating the predictions of multiple algorithms can give more reliable and robust prediction than the single algorithm, with the AUC score improved to 92.26{\%}. We applied our combinatorial prioritization algorithm to lung neoplasms and breast neoplasms, and revealed their top 30 microRNA candidates, which are in consistent with the published literatures and databases.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs which are involved in the posttranscriptional modulation of gene expression. Their short (18-24) single stranded mature sequences are involved in targeting specific genes. It turns out that experimental methods are limited and that it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish all miRNAs and their targets experimentally. Therefore, many tools for the prediction of miRNA genes and miRNA targets have been proposed. Most of these tools are based on machine learning methods and within that area mostly two-class classification is employed. Unfortunately, truly negative data is impossible to attain and only approximations of negative data are currently available. Also, we recently showed that the available positive data is not flawless. Here we investigate the impact of class imbalance on the learner accuracy and find that there is a difference of up to 50{\%} between the best and worst precision and recall values. In addition, we looked at increasing number of features and found a curve maximizing at 0.97 recall and 0.91 precision with quickly decaying performance after inclusion of more than 100 features. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The main reason for this remarkable interest is the increasing number of research papers reporting that cell-free circulating miRNA mediates both short-range and distant communication between various cells, and could impact on diverse physiological and pathological processes. However, there are also multiple conflicting lines of evidence that challenge the biological significance of circulating ex-miRNA, suggesting that they are merely byproducts of cell activity and cell death without any particular function.

@article{Agatonovic-Kustrin2000,
abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are biologically inspired computer programs designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes information. ANNs gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data and learn (or are trained) through experience, not from programming. An ANN is formed from hundreds of single units, artificial neurons or processing elements (PE), connected with coefficients (weights), which constitute the neural structure and are organised in layers. The power of neural computations comes from connecting neurons in a network. Each PE has weighted inputs, transfer function and one output. The behavior of a neural network is determined by the transfer functions of its neurons, by the learning rule, and by the architecture itself. The weights are the adjustable parameters and, in that sense, a neural network is a parameterized system. The weighed sum of the inputs constitutes the activation of the neuron. The activation signal is passed through transfer function to produce a single output of the neuron. Transfer function introduces non-linearity to the network. During training, the inter-unit connections are optimized until the error in predictions is minimized and the network reaches the specified level of accuracy. Once the network is trained and tested it can be given new input information to predict the output. Many types of neural networks have been designed already and new ones are invented every week but all can be described by the transfer functions of their neurons, by the learning rule, and by the connection formula. ANN represents a promising modeling technique, especially for data sets having non-linear relationships which are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical processes. In terms of model specification, artificial neural networks require no knowledge of the data source but, since they often contain many weights that must be estimated, they require large training sets. In addition, ANNs can combine and incorporate both literature-based and experimental data to solve problems. The various applications of ANNs can be summarised into classification or pattern recognition, prediction and modeling. Supervised associating networks can be applied in pharmaceutical fields as an alternative to conventional response surface methodology. Unsupervised feature-extracting networks represent an alternative to principal component analysis. Non-adaptive unsupervised networks are able to reconstruct their patterns when presented with noisy samples and can be used for image recognition. The potential applications of ANN methodology in the pharmaceutical sciences range from interpretation of analytical data, drug and dosage form design through biopharmacy to clinical pharmacy.

abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images - two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets - consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a class of machine learning methods that are gaining success and attracting interest in many domains, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games. Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field. Radiologists should become familiar with the principles and potential applications of deep learning in medical imaging.},

These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patientspecific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.},

For deep learning in radiology to succeed, note that well-annotated large data sets are needed since deep networks are complex, computer software and hardware are evolving constantly, and subtle differences in disease states are more difficult to perceive than differences in everyday objects. In the future, machine learning in radiology is expected to have a substantial clinical impact with imaging examinations being routinely obtained in clinical practice, providing an opportunity to improve decision support in medical image interpretation. The term of note is decision support, indicating that computers will augment human decision making, making it more effective and efficient. The clinical impact of having computers in the routine clinical practice may allow radiologists to further integrate their knowledge with their clinical colleagues in other medical specialties and allow for precision medicine.},

abstract = {Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells and oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with tumors. The last decade has seen significant advances in the development of biomarkers in oncology that play a critical role in understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms which drive tumor initiation, maintenance and progression. Clinical molecular diagnostics and biomarker discoveries in oncology are advancing rapidly as we begin to understand the complex mechanisms that transform a normal cell into an abnormal one. These discoveries have fueled the development of novel drug targets and new treatment strategies. The standard of care for patients with advanced-stage cancers has shifted away from an empirical treatment strategy based on the clinical-pathological profile to one where a biomarker driven treatment algorithm based on the molecular profile of the tumor is used. Recent advances in multiplex genotyping technologies and high-throughput genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing make possible the rapid and comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome of individual patients even from very little tumor biopsy material. Predictive (diagnostic) biomarkers are helpful in matching targeted therapies with patients and in preventing toxicity of standard (systemic) therapies. Prognostic biomarkers identify somatic germ line mutations, changes in DNA methylation, elevated levels of microRNA (miRNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood. Predictive biomarkers using molecular diagnostics are currently in use in clinical practice of personalized oncotherapy for the treatment of five diseases: chronic myeloid leukemia, colon, breast, lung cancer and melanoma and these biomarkers are being used successfully to evaluate benefits that can be achieved through targeted therapy. Examples of these molecularly targeted biomarker therapies are: tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors; anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors in lung cancer with EML4-ALk fusion; HER2/neu blockage in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer; and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) inhibition in EGFR-mutated lung cancer. This review presents the current state of our knowledge of biomarkers in five selected cancers: chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.},

Altogether, over 14 000 miRNA sets have been added, including pathways, diseases, organs and target genes. Importantly, our tool can be applied for miRNA precursors as well as mature miRNAs. To make the tool as useful as possible we additionally implemented supporting tools such as converters between different miRBase versions and converters from miRNA names to precursor names.

In this context, this paper presents a sparse auto encoder method for feature transfer learning for speech emotion recognition.

abstract = {Cancer diagnosis is currently undergoing a paradigm shift with the incorporation of molecular biomarkers as part of routine diagnostic panel. This breakthrough discovery directs researches to examine the role of microRNA in cancer, since its deregulation is often associated with almost all human tumors. Such differences frequently recur in tumor-specific microRNA signatures, which are helpful to diagnose tissue of origin and tumor subtypes. Nonetheless, the resulting classification problem is far from trivial, as there are hundreds of microRNA types, and tumors are non-linearly correlated to the presence of several overexpressions. In this paper, we propose to apply an evolutionary optimized convolutional neural network classifier to this complex task. The presented approach is compared against 21 state-of-the-art classifiers, on a real-world dataset featuring 8129 patients, for 29 different classes of tumors, using 1046 different biomarkers. As a result of the comparison, we also present a meta-analysis on the dataset, identifying the classes on which the collective performance of the considered classifiers is less effective, and thus possibly singling out types of tumors for which biomarker tests might be less reliable.},

abstract = {The war on cancer is progressing globally but slowly as researchers around the world continue to seek and discover more innovative and effective ways of curing this catastrophic disease. Organizing biological information, representing it, and making it accessible, or biocuration, is an important aspect of biomedical research and discovery. However, because maintaining sophisticated biocuration is highly resource dependent, it continues to lag behind the continually being generated biomedical data. Another critical aspect of cancer research, pathway analysis, has proven to be an efficient method for gaining insight into the underlying biology associated with cancer. We propose a deep-learning-based model, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder Multi-Label Learning (SdaMLL), for facilitating gene multi-function discovery and pathway completion. SdaMLL can capture intermediate representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern and generate low-dimensional codes superior to conditional dimension reduction tools. Experimental results indicate that SdaMLL outperforms existing classical multi-label algorithms. Moreover, we found some gene functions, such as Fused in Sarcoma (FUS, which may be part of transcriptional misregulation in cancer) and p27 (which we expect will become a member viral carcinogenesis), that can be used to complete the related pathways. We provide a visual tool (https://www.keaml.cn/gpvisual) to view the new gene functions in cancer pathways.},

A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is demonstrated that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals to unity (as well as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals to two).

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from unbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy. {\textcopyright} 2002 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

abstract = {Since microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, miRNA identification is one of the most essential problems in computational biology. miRNAs are usually short in length ranging between 20 and 23 base pairs. It is thus often difficult to distinguish miRNA-encoding sequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar length, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs instead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional machine-learning-based classification methods have been proposed, but they often have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering, and their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel miRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural networks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene automatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual feature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect structural characteristics of precursor miRNAs. For the performance evaluation of our approach, we have employed several widely used evaluation metrics on three recent benchmark datasets and verified that deepMiRGene delivered comparable performance among the current state-of-the-art tools.},

It is anticipated that precise miRNA-disease association prediction could not only help infer potential disease-related miRNA but also boost human diagnosis and disease prevention. Considering the limitations of previous computational models, a more effective computational model needs to be implemented to predict miRNA-disease associations. In this work, we first constructed a human miRNA-miRNA similarity network utilizing miRNA-miRNA functional similarity data and heterogeneous miRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarities based on the assumption that similar miRNAs with similar functions tend to be associated with similar diseases, and vice versa. Then, we constructed disease-disease similarity using disease semantic information and heterogeneous disease-related interaction data. We proposed a deep ensemble model called DeepMDA that extracts high-level features from similarity information using stacked autoencoders and then predicts miRNA-disease associations by adopting a 3-layer neural network. In addition to five-fold cross-validation, we also proposed another cross-validation method to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that the proposed model is superior to previous methods with high robustness.},

abstract = {Background: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. Results: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. Conclusion: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma +voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.},

abstract = {Background: The application of next-generation sequencing technology to gene expression quantification analysis, namely, RNA-Sequencing, has transformed the way in which gene expression studies are conducted and analyzed. These advances are of particular interest to researchers studying organisms with missing or incomplete genomes, as the need for knowledge of sequence information is overcome. De novo assembly methods have gained widespread acceptance in the RNA-Seq community for organisms with no true reference genome or transcriptome. While such methods have tremendous utility, computational cost is still a significant challenge for organisms with large and complex genomes.Results: In this manuscript, we present a comparison of four reference-based mapping methods for non-human primate data. We utilize TopHat2 and GSNAP for mapping to the human genome, and Bowtie2 and Stampy for mapping to the human genome and transcriptome for a total of six mapping approaches. For each of these methods, we explore mapping rates and locations, number of detected genes, correlations between computed expression values, and the utility of the resulting data for differential expression analysis.Conclusions: We show that reference-based mapping methods indeed have utility in RNA-Seq analysis of mammalian data with no true reference, and the details of mapping methods should be carefully considered when doing so. Critical algorithm features include short seed sequences, the allowance of mismatches, and the allowance of gapped alignments in addition to splice junction gaps. Such features facilitate sensitive alignment of non-human primate RNA-Seq data to a human reference. {\textcopyright} 2014 Benjamin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (≥ 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},

abstract = {Ibrutinib and idelalisib, B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway inhibitors, have been recently approved for use against relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To assess the efficacy and safety of BCR pathway inhibitors in relapsed/refractory CLL, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials (1866 patients). Our study demonstrated that BCR pathway inhibitors significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; pooled HR = 0.24; 95{\%} CI: 0.19–0.30) and overall survival (HR = 0.58; 0.46–0.73) compared with control treatment. BCR pathway inhibitors increased the probability of response (RR = 3.54; 95{\%} CI: 1.69–7.41) and decreased the risk of progression (RR = 0.21, 95{\%} CI: 0.13–0.34). However, BCR pathway inhibitors increased the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs; RR = 1.25; 95{\%} CI: 1.08–1.44) and serious AEs (RR = 1.32; 95{\%} CI: 1.17–1.50).

@article{Chen2017,
abstract = {Background: Some applications, especially those clinical applications requiring high accuracy of sequencing data, usually have to face the troubles caused by unavoidable sequencing errors. Several tools have been proposed to profile the sequencing quality, but few of them can quantify or correct the sequencing errors. This unmet requirement motivated us to develop AfterQC, a tool with functions to profile sequencing errors and correct most of them, plus highly automated quality control and data filtering features. Different from most tools, AfterQC analyses the overlapping of paired sequences for pair-end sequencing data. Based on overlapping analysis, AfterQC can detect and cut adapters, and furthermore it gives a novel function to correct wrong bases in the overlapping regions. Another new feature is to detect and visualise sequencing bubbles, which can be commonly found on the flowcell lanes and may raise sequencing errors. Besides normal per cycle quality and base content plotting, AfterQC also provides features like polyX (a long sub-sequence of a same base X) filtering, automatic trimming and K-MER based strand bias profiling. Results: For each single or pair of FastQ files, AfterQC filters out bad reads, detects and eliminates sequencer's bubble effects, trims reads at front and tail, detects the sequencing errors and corrects part of them, and finally outputs clean data and generates HTML reports with interactive figures. AfterQC can run in batch mode with multiprocess support, it can run with a single FastQ file, a single pair of FastQ files (for pair-end sequencing), or a folder for all included FastQ files to be processed automatically. Based on overlapping analysis, AfterQC can estimate the sequencing error rate and profile the error transform distribution. The results of our error profiling tests show that the error distribution is highly platform dependent. Conclusion: Much more than just another new quality control (QC) tool, AfterQC is able to perform quality control, data filtering, error profiling and base correction automatically. Experimental results show that AfterQC can help to eliminate the sequencing errors for pair-end sequencing data to provide much cleaner outputs, and consequently help to reduce the false-positive variants, especially for the low-frequency somatic mutations. While providing rich configurable options, AfterQC can detect and set all the options automatically and require no argument in most cases.},

@article{Komseli2018,
abstract = {Background: Senescence is a fundamental biological process implicated in various pathologies, including cancer. Regarding carcinogenesis, senescence signifies, at least in its initial phases, an anti-tumor response that needs to be circumvented for cancer to progress. Micro-RNAs, a subclass of regulatory, non-coding RNAs, participate in senescence regulation. At the subcellular level micro-RNAs, similar to proteins, have been shown to traffic between organelles influencing cellular behavior. The differential function of micro-RNAs relative to their subcellular localization and their role in senescence biology raises concurrent in situ analysis of coding and non-coding gene products in senescent cells as a necessity. However, technical challenges have rendered in situ co-detection unfeasible until now. Methods: In the present report we describe a methodology that bypasses these technical limitations achieving for the first time simultaneous detection of both a micro-RNA and a protein in the biological context of cellular senescence, utilizing the new commercially available SenTraGorTM compound. The method was applied in a prototypical human non-malignant epithelial model of oncogene-induced senescence that we generated for the purposes of the study. For the characterization of this novel system, we applied a wide range of cellular and molecular techniques, as well as high-throughput analysis of the transcriptome and micro-RNAs. Results: This experimental setting has three advantages that are presented and discussed: i) it covers a "gap" in the molecular carcinogenesis field, as almost all corresponding in vitro models are fibroblast-based, even though the majority of neoplasms have epithelial origin, ii) it recapitulates the precancerous and cancerous phases of epithelial tumorigenesis within a short time frame under the light of natural selection and iii) it uses as an oncogenic signal, the replication licensing factor CDC6, implicated in both DNA replication and transcription when over-expressed, a characteristic that can be exploited to monitor RNA dynamics. Conclusions: Consequently, we demonstrate that our model is optimal for studying the molecular basis of epithelial carcinogenesis shedding light on the tumor-initiating events. The latter may reveal novel molecular targets with clinical benefit. Besides, since this method can be incorporated in a wide range of low, medium or high-throughput image-based approaches, we expect it to be broadly applicable.},

abstract = {Cancer diagnosis is currently undergoing a paradigm shift with the incorporation of molecular biomarkers as part of routine diagnostic panel. This breakthrough discovery directs researches to examine the role of microRNA in cancer, since its deregulation is often associated with almost all human tumors. Such differences frequently recur in tumor-specific microRNA signatures, which are helpful to diagnose tissue of origin and tumor subtypes. Nonetheless, the resulting classification problem is far from trivial, as there are hundreds of microRNA types, and tumors are non-linearly correlated to the presence of several overexpressions. In this paper, we propose to apply an evolutionary optimized convolutional neural network classifier to this complex task. The presented approach is compared against 21 state-of-the-art classifiers, on a real-world dataset featuring 8129 patients, for 29 different classes of tumors, using 1046 different biomarkers. As a result of the comparison, we also present a meta-analysis on the dataset, identifying the classes on which the collective performance of the considered classifiers is less effective, and thus possibly singling out types of tumors for which biomarker tests might be less reliable.},

To accomplish this, many researchers are turning toward machine learning (ML), an approach of artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes modern algorithms to give computers the ability to learn. Much of the effort to advance ML for precision medicine has been focused on the development and implementation of algorithms and the generation of ever larger quantities of genomic sequence data and electronic health records. However, relevance and accuracy of the data are as important as quantity of data in the advancement of ML for precision medicine. For common diseases, physiological genomic readouts in disease-applicable tissues may be an effective surrogate to measure the effect of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions that underlie disease development and progression. Disease-applicable tissue may be difficult to obtain, but there are important exceptions such as kidney needle biopsy specimens. As AI continues to advance, new analytical approaches, including those that go beyond data correlation, need to be developed and ethical issues of AI need to be addressed. Physiological genomic readouts in disease-relevant tissues, combined with advanced AI, can be a powerful approach for precision medicine for common diseases.},

We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem.

abstract = {Demand for new technologies that deliver fast, inexpensive and accurate genome information has never been greater. This challenge has catalysed the rapid development of advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS). The generation of large volumes of sequence data and the speed of data acquisition are the primary advantages over previous, more standard methods. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration granted marketing authorisation for the first high-throughput NG sequencer, Illumina's MiSeqDx, which allowed the development and use of a large number of new genome-based tests. Here, we present a review of template preparation, nucleic acid sequencing and imaging, genome assembly and alignment approaches as well as recent advances in current and near-term commercially available NGS instruments. We also outline the broad range of applications for NGS technologies and provide guidelines for platform selection to best address biological questions of interest. DNA sequencing has revolutionised biological and medical research, and is poised to have a similar impact on the practice of medicine. This tool is but one of an increasing arsenal of developing tools that enhance our capabilities to identify, quantify and functionally characterise the components of biological networks that keep us healthy or make us sick. Despite advances in other 'omic' technologies, DNA sequencing and analysis, in many respects, have played the leading role to date. The new technologies provide a bridge between genotype and phenotype, both in man and model organisms, and have revolutionised how risk of developing a complex human disease may be assessed. The generation of large DNA sequence data sets is producing a wealth of medically relevant information on a large number of individuals and populations that will potentially form the basis of truly individualised medical care in the future. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.},

abstract = {Mature miRNAs are 19-24 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in living cells by mediating targeted hydrolysis and translation inhibition of mRNAs. In recent years, miRNAs have been detected in a variety of biological fluids as extracellular nuclease-resistant entities. Importantly, extracellular circulating miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in blood plasma or serum during the course of many diseases, including cancer, and are promising noninvasive biomarkers. However, the biological function of extracellular miRNAs remains questionable. In this article, we summarise the current theories regarding extracellular miRNA origin and function, and suggest that these miRNAs are mostly byproducts of cellular activity. Nevertheless, some extracellular miRNA species might also carry cell-cell signaling function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously initiated, small non-coding RNAs and typically regulate the expression of mRNAs in post transcriptional level either via translational repression or mRNA degradation. Aberrant expression of miRNAs is observed in diverse disease and altered physiological states. Recently, it has been revealed that miRNAs are not only present in cells but also in extracellular milieu especially in different bio-fluids including blood plasma, follicular fluid and even in cell culture media. Such extracellular miRNAs (ECmiRNAs) are remarkably stable in the extracellular harsh environment with the presence of high RNAse activity. Although the precise mechanisms of release of cellular miRNAs to extracellular environment remain largely unknown, recent studies suggest that the expression of these ECmiRNAs can be associated with patho-physiological condition of an organism. Moreover, these ECmiRNAs may deliver to the recipient cells via certain pathways where they can regulate translational activity of target genes. This review will discuss the nature and stability of ECmiRNAs along with their release mechanisms. Furthermore, based on recent evidences, it also summarizes the possible function of these ECmiRNAs in distant cell-to-cell communication and the difficulties we may face during ECmiRNA research.},

abstract = {Treatment of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine (GEM) is limited due to its rapid plasma metabolism and development of chemoresistance. MicroRNA (miRNA) regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and induces chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this study, we observed differential downregulation of miR-205 (miR-205-5p) in human pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Compared to GEM-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells, miR-205 was highly downregulated in GEM-resistant MIA PaCa-2R cells. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-205 inhibits MIA PaCa-2R cell proliferation after GEM-treatment. Further investigation confirmed that miR-205 alone significantly reduces the proliferation of CSCs and tumor growth in mouse models. However, miR-205 in combination with GEM was more efficient in reducing the proliferation of CSCs and 3D spheroids. Moreover, miR-205 overexpressing MIA PaCa-2R cells induced orthotopic tumor growth was significantly inhibited after intravenous administration of GEM-conjugated methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate)-graft-gemcitabine-graft-dodecanol (mPEG-b-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC) (mPEG-b-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC) polymeric micelles. Also, a reduction in CSCs, EMT and chemoresistance markers was observed in miR-205 overexpressing MIA PaCa-2R cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of orthotopic tumors showed a decrease in drug resistance protein caveolin-1 and cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in combination treatment. Overall, our findings suggest that miR-205 resensitizes GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells to GEM and acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA.},

abstract = {Background: Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the most lethal gastrointestinal (GI) tumor. Although many studies on differentially expressed miRNAs as candidate biomarkers of pancreatic cancer have been published, reliability of these findings generated from investigations performed in single laboratory settings remain unclear. Results: There were 29 articles with a total of 2,225 patients and 1,618 controls included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 82{\%} (95{\%} CI, 79-85{\%}); the specificity was 85{\%} (95{\%} CI, 79-89{\%}); and area under the curve (AUC) was 0.89 (95{\%} CI, 0.86-0.92). Subgroup analyses indicated that there were significant divergences between Caucasian and Asian subgroups for circulating miRNA analysis. Materials And Methods: To comprehensively investigate the potential utility of miRNAs as biomarkers of the disease, we searched publications diagnosing PaCa using miRNAs from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were used to examine the overall test performance, and heterogeneity was analyzed with the I2 test. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrated that multiple miRNAs (SEN: 85{\%}; SPE: 89{\%}; AUC: 0.93) were more accurate for diagnosing PaCa than a single miRNA (SEN: 78{\%}; SPE: 79{\%}; AUC: 0.84), and future studies are still needed to confirm the diagnostic value of these pooled miRNAs for PaCa.},

abstract = {Purpose: Our goal was to identify circulating micro RNA (miRNA) levels that could distinguish patients with low-stage pancreatic cancer from healthy and disease controls. Experimental Design: We measured 735 miRNAs in pancreatic cancer case and control sera by QRTPCR using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays. After array analysis, we selected 18 miRNA candidates for validation in an independent set of cases and control samples. Results: Of the significantly elevated circulating miRNAs in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls, miR-1290 had the best diagnostic performance: receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on miR-1290 serum level yielded curve areas (AUC) of 0.96 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.91-1.00], 0.81 (0.71-0.91), and 0.80 (0.67-0.93), for subjects with pancreatic cancer ( n = 41) relative to healthy controls (n = 19), subjects with chronic pancreatitis (n = 35), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( n = 18), respectively. Serum miR-1290 levels were also significantly higher than healthy controls among patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN; n = 20; AUC = 0.76, 0.61-0.91). Serum miR-1290 levels distinguished patients with low-stage pancreatic cancer from controls better than CA19-9 levels, and like CA19-9, higher miR-1290 levels predicted poorer outcome among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Greater numbers of miR-1290 transcripts were detected by FISH in primary pancreatic cancer and IPMN than normal pancreatic duct cells. miR-1290 influenced in vitro pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasive ability. Several other circulating miRNAs distinguished sera of patients with pancreatic cancer from those of healthy controls with AUCs {\textgreater}0.7, including miR-24, miR-134, miR-146a, miR-378, miR-484, miR-628-3p, and miR-1825.

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) under transcriptional control of the HNF1$\beta$ transcription factor, and investigate whether its effect manifests in serum. Methods: The Polish cohort (N = 60) consisted of 11 patients with HNF1B-MODY, 17 with HNF1A-MODY, 13 with GCK-MODY, an HbA1c-matched type 1 diabetic group (n = 9) and ten healthy controls. Replication was performed in 61 clinically-matched British patients mirroring the groups in the Polish cohort. The Polish cohort underwent miRNA serum level profiling with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) arrays to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Validation was performed using qPCR. To determine whether serum content reflects alterations at a cellular level, we quantified miRNA levels in a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) with small interfering RNA knockdowns of HNF1$\alpha$ or HNF1$\beta$. Results: Significant differences (adjusted p {\textless} 0.05) were noted for 11 miRNAs. Five of them differed between HNF1A-MODY and HNF1B-MODY, and, amongst those, four (miR-24, miR-27b, miR-223 and miR-199a) showed HNF1B-MODY-specific expression levels in the replication group. In all four cases the miRNA expression level was lower in HNF1B-MODY than in all other tested groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.79 to 0.86, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 91.7{\%} (miR-24) and 82.1{\%} (miR-199a), respectively. The cellular expression pattern of miRNA was consistent with serum levels, as all were significantly higher in HNF1$\alpha$- than in HNF1$\beta$-deficient HepG2 cells. Conclusions/interpretation: We have shown that expression of specific miRNAs depends on HNF1$\beta$ function. The impact of HNF1$\beta$ deficiency was evidenced at serum level, making HNF1$\beta$-dependent miRNAs potentially applicable in the diagnosis of HNF1B-MODY.},

abstract = {Background: To improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer, new biomarkers are required for earlier, pre-symptomatic diagnosis. Epigenetic mutations take place at the earliest stages of tumorigenesis and therefore offer new approaches for detecting and diagnosing disease. Nucleosomes are the repeating subunits of DNA and histone proteins that constitute human chromatin. Because of their release into the circulation, intact nucleosome levels in serum or plasma can serve as diagnostic disease biomarkers, and elevated levels have been reported in various cancers. However, quantifying nucleosomes in the circulation for cancer detection has been challenging due to nonspecific elevation in sera of patients with benign diseases. Here, we report for the first time differential, disease-associated epigenetic profiles of intact cell-free nucleosomes (cfnucleosomes) containing specific DNA and histone modifications as well as histone variants circulating in the blood. The study comprised serum samples from 59 individuals, including 25 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, 10 patients with benign pancreatic disease, and 24 healthy individuals using Nucleosomics{\textregistered}, a novel ELISA method. Results: Multivariate analysis defined a panel of five serum cfnucleosome biomarkers that gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 for the discrimination of pancreatic cancer from healthy controls, which was superior to the diagnostic performance of the common pancreatic tumor biomarker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) with an AUC of 0.87. Combining CA 19-9 with a panel of four cfnucleosome biomarkers gave an AUC of 0.98 with an overall sensitivity of 92 {\%} at 90 {\%} specificity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that global epigenetic profiling of cfnucleosomes in serum using a simple NuQ{\textregistered} immunoassay-based approach can provide novel diagnostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.},

We hypothesized that any CA 19-9 elevation indicates biologically borderline resectability. Study Design The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB 2010 to 2012) was reviewed for PDAC patients with reported CA 19-9. Nonsecretors were analyzed separately. Early stage (I/II) patients were stratified by CA 19-9 above or below normal (37 U/mL). Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox proportional hazards survival modeling were performed. Results Of 113,145 patients, only 28,074 (24.8{\%}) had CA 19-9 measured and reported, and this proportion was stage independent. Among early stage patients (n = 10,806), there were 957 (8.8{\%}) nonsecretors, 2,708 (25.1{\%}) with normal levels, and 7,141 (66.1{\%}) with elevated levels. Demographics and perioperative outcomes were similar between these groups. Survival was worse in all stages in patients with CA 19-9 elevation. Nonsecretors had survival similar to that of patients with normal levels. Early stage patients with elevated CA 19-9 had decreased survival at 1, 2, and 3 years (56{\%} vs 68{\%}, 30{\%} vs 42{\%}, 15{\%} vs 25{\%}, all p {\textless} 0.001) relative to patients with normal levels. Adjusted modeling confirmed this finding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, p {\textless} 0.001). Repeat modeling in the neoadjuvant cohort demonstrated this to be the only treatment sequence to completely abrogate increased mortality due to CA 19-9 elevation (p = 0.11). Conclusions The minority of PDAC patients have CA 19-9 measured and reported in NCDB. The CA 19-9 nonsecretors and normal-level patients achieve equivalent survival. Elevation of CA 19-9 is associated with decreased stage-specific survival, with the greatest difference in early stages. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy followed by curative intent surgery best mitigates the increased mortality hazard. Patients with PDAC who have elevated CA 19-9 levels at diagnosis are biologically borderline resectable regardless of anatomic resectability, and neoadjuvant systemic therapy is suggested.},

Deregulated miRNA expression has been described in patients with PDAC. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of 6 miRNAs (miR-21, -34a, -155, -196a, -200b, and -376a involved in PDAC tumorigenesis) in serum and salivary samples to assess their potential role as circulating diagnostics biomarkers. Methods Serum and salivary samples were collected from patients with PDAC and healthy controls, and miRNA levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Twenty-four patients with PDAC and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Results A significant difference between PDAC and healthy groups was observed for the expression of miR-21 and miR-34a (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.001) in serum samples. Both miRNAs accurately discriminated between the 2 groups, with an area under the curve for miR-21 and miR-34a of 0.889 (P = 0.001) and 0.865 (P = 0.002), respectively. In general, the expression of miRNAs between salivary samples did not differ. Conclusions Serum miR-21 and miR-34a are potentially useful diagnostic biomarkers of PDAC. In addition, our results suggest that these miRNAs are not differentially expressed in saliva, making them unsuitable for use as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.},

abstract = {Although the inflammation-associated cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in cholangiocarcinoma growth, the relationship between IL-6 and oncogenic changes is unknown. IL-6 can increase expression of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT-1) and epigenetically regulate the expression of several genes, including microRNAs (miRNAs). DNMT-1 up-regulation occurs in hepatobiliary cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. To understand the potential regulation of DNMT-1 by IL-6-dependent miRNAs, we examined the expression of a group of miRNAs which have sequence complementarity to the 3'-untranslated region of DNMT-1, namely miR-148a, miR-152, and miR-301. The expression of these miRNAs was decreased in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Moreover, the expression of all three miRNAs was decreased in IL-6-overexpressing malignant cholangiocytes in vitro and in tumor cell xenografts. There was a concomitant decrease in expression of the methylationsensitive tumor suppressor genes Rassf1a and p16INK4a. Using luciferase reporter constructs, DNMT-1 was verified as a target for miR-148a and miR-152. Precursors to miR-148a and miR-152 decreased DNMT-1 protein expression, increased Rassf1a and p16INK4a expression, and reduced cell proliferation. Conclusion: These data indicate that IL-6 can regulate the activity of DNMT-1 and expression of methylation- dependent tumor suppressor genes by modulation of miR-148a and miR-152, and provide a link between this inflammation-associated cytokine and oncogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma.

abstract = {Recent studies posit a role for non-coding RNAs in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Combining small RNA sequencing from 179 human serum samples with a neural network analysis produced a miRNA algorithm for diagnosis of EOC (AUC 0.90; 95{\%} CI: 0.81-0.99). The model significantly outperformed CA125 and functioned well regardless of patient age, histology, or stage. Among 454 patients with various diagnoses, the miRNA neural network had 100{\%} specificity for ovarian cancer. After using 325 samples to adapt the neural network to qPCR measurements, the model was validated using 51 independent clinical samples, with a positive predictive value of 91.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 73.3-97.6{\%}) and negative predictive value of 78.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 64.2-88.2{\%}). Finally, biologic relevance was tested using in situ hybridization on 30 pre-metastatic lesions, showing intratumoral concentration of relevant miRNAs. These data suggest circulating miRNAs have potential to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (≥ 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

abstract = {The efficacy of radiotherapy in many tumor types is limited by normal tissue toxicity and by intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular network responsible for regulating radiosensitivity/resistance. Here, an unbiased functional screen identified four microRNAs (miR1, miR125a, miR150, and miR425) that induce radioresistance. Considering the clinical importance of radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma, the impact of these miRNAs on glioblastoma radioresistance was investigated. Overexpression of miR1, miR125a, miR150, and/or miR425 in glioblastoma promotes radioresistance through upregulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint response. Conversely, antagonizing with antagomiRs sensitizes glioblastoma cells to irradiation, suggesting their potential as targets for inhibiting therapeutic resistance. Analysis of glioblastoma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that these miRNAs are expressed in glioblastoma patient specimens and correlate with TGFb signaling. Finally, it is demonstrated that expression of miR1 and miR125a can be induced by TGFb and antagonized by a TGFb receptor inhibitor. Together, these results identify and characterize a new role for miR425, miR1, miR125, and miR150 in promoting radioresistance in glioblastomas and provide insight into the therapeutic application of TGFb inhibitors in radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the application value of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125 and CA242 in diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer cases treated with concurrent chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: 52 patients with pancreatic cancer, 40 with benign pancreatic diseases and 40 healthy people were selected. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method was used for detecting levels of CA19-9, CEA and CA125, and a CanAg CA242 enzyme linked immunoassay kit for assessing the level of CA242. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for analyzing the prognostic factors of patients with pancreatic cancer. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for analyzing the hazard ratio (HR) and 95{\%} confidential interval (CI) for survival time of patients with pancreatic cancer. Results: The levels of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125 and CA242 in patients with pancreatic cancer were significantly higher than those in patients with benign pancreatic diseases and healthy people (P {\textless} 0.001). The sensitivity of CA19-9 was the highest among these, followed by CA242, CA125 and CEA. The specificity of CA242 is the highest, followed by CA125, CEA and CA19-9. The sensitivity and specificity of joint detection of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125and CA242 were 90.4{\%} and 93.8{\%}, obviously higher than single detection of those markers in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The median survival time of 52 patients with pancreatic cancer was 10 months (95{\%} CI7.389{\~{}}12.611).. Patients with the increasing level of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125, CA242 had shorter survival times (P=0.047. 0.043, 0.0041, 0.029). COX regression analysis showed that CA19-9 was an independent prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer (P=0.001, 95{\%}CI 2.591{\~{}}38.243). Conclusions: The detection of serum tumor markers (CA19.9, CEA, CA125 and CA242) is conducive to the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and joint detection of tumor markers helps improve the diagnostic efficiency. Moreover, CA19-9 is an independent prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs have potential as diagnostic cancer biomarkers. The aim of this study was (1) to define microRNA expression patterns in formalin-fixed parafin-embedded tissue from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, ampullary adenocarcinoma, normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis without using micro-dissection and (2) to discover new diagnostic microRNAs and combinations of microRNAs in cancer tissue. The expression of 664 microRNAs in tissue from 170 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 107 ampullary adenocarcinomas were analyzed using a commercial microRNA assay. Results were compared with chronic pancreatitis, normal pancreas and duodenal adenocarcinoma. In all, 43 microRNAs had higher and 41 microRNAs reduced expression in pancreatic cancer compared with normal pancreas. In all, 32 microRNAs were differently expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with chronic pancreatitis (17 higher; 15 reduced). Several of these microRNAs have not before been related to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (eg, miR-492, miR-614, miR-622). MiR-614, miR-492, miR-622, miR-135b and miR-196 were most differently expressed. MicroRNA profiles of pancreatic and ampullary adenocarcinomas were correlated (0.990). MicroRNA expression profiles for pancreatic cancer described in the literature were consistent with our findings, and the microRNA profile for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (miR-196b-miR-217) was validated. We identified a more significant expression profile, the difference between miR-411 and miR-198 (P2.06 × 10 54) and a diagnostic LASSO classifier using 19 microRNAs (sensitivity 98.5{\%}; positive predictive value 97.8{\%}; accuracy 97.0{\%}). We also identified microRNA profiles to subclassify ampullary adenocarcinomas into pancreatobiliary or intestinal type. In conclusion, we found that combinations of two microRNAs could roughly separate neoplastic from non-neoplastic samples. A diagnostic 19 microRNA classifier was constructed which without micro-dissection could discriminate pancreatic and ampullary adenocarcinomas from chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreas with high sensitivity and accuracy. Ongoing prospective studies will evaluate if these microRNA profiles are useful on fine-needle biopsies for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 USCAP, Inc.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease for a multitude of reasons including very late diagnosis. This in part is due to the lack of understanding of the biological behavior of PDAC and the ineffective screening for this disease. Significant efforts have been dedicated to finding the appropriate serum and imaging biomarkers to help early detection and predict response to treatment of PDAC. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) has been the most validated serum marker and has the highest positive predictive value as a stand-alone marker. When combined with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125), CA 19-9 can help predict the outcome of patients to surgery and chemotherapy. A slew of novel serum markers including multimarker panels as well as genetic and epigenetic materials have potential for early detection of pancreatic cancer, although these remain to be validated in larger trials. Imaging studies may not correlate with elevated serum markers. Critical features for determining PDAC include the presence of a mass, dilated pancreatic duct, and a duct cut-off sign. Features that are indicative of early metastasis includes neurovascular bundle involvement, duodenal invasion, and greater post contrast enhancement. 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) radiotracer uptake and changes following treatment may predict patient overall survival following treatment. Similarly, pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may predict prognosis with lower ADC lesions having worse outcome. Although these markers have provided significant improvement in the care of pancreatic cancer patients, further advancements can be made with perhaps better combination of markers or discovery of unique marker(s) to pancreatic cancer.},

Here we update an evaluation of the accuracy of CA 19-9 and CEA, and, unlike previous reviews, focus on discrimination between malignant and benign disease instead of normal controls. In 57 studies involving 3,285 pancreatic carcinoma cases, the combined sensitivity of CA 19-9 was 78.2{\%} and in 37 studies involving 1,882 cases with benign pancreatic disease the specificity of CA 19-9 was 82.8{\%}. From the combined analysis of studies reporting CEA, the sensitivity was 44.2{\%} (1,324 cases) and the specificity was 84.8{\%} (656 cases). These measurements more appropriately reflect the expected biomarker accuracy in the differential diagnosis of patients with periampullary diseases.

Data collected included demographics, diagnosis date, clinical stage, treatment, and outcome; 1,082 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed further. The chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression. Differences in survival analyses were determined using the log-rank test.Results: The distribution of clinical stages was: I, 2.2{\%}; II, 3.4{\%}; III, 13{\%}; IVa, 27{\%}; and IVb, 55{\%}. Chemotherapy alone was administered to 42{\%} of patients and 17{\%} underwent resection. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 39{\%}, 13{\%}, and 6.9{\%}, respectively. The median survival time was 257 days, but differed considerably among treatments and clinical stages. Demographics, distribution of clinical stage, and cause of death did not differ between groups A (2001-2005, n = 406) and B (2006-2010, n = 676). However, group B included more patients who underwent chemotherapy (P {\textless} 0.0001) and fewer treated with best supportive care (P = 0.0004), mirroring improvements in this group's long-term outcomes (P = 0.0063).

The significance of serum microRNA (miR) levels in pancreatic neoplasm such as pancreatic cancer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) diagnosis remains unclear. We herein evaluated the usefulness of miRs enclosed in serum exosomes (ExmiRs) as diagnostic markers. Methods: The ExmiRs from patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 32) or IPMN (n = 29), and patients without neoplasms (controls; n = 22) were enriched using ExoQuick-TC™. The expression of ExmiRs was evaluated using a next-generation sequencing analysis, and the selected three miRs through this analysis were confirmed by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The expression of ExmiR-191, ExmiR-21 and ExmiR-451a was significantly up-regulated in patients with pancreatic cancer and IPMN compared to the controls (p {\textless} 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve and the diagnostic accuracy of ExmiRs were 5-20{\%} superior to those of three serum bulky circulating miRs (e.g.; ExmiR-21: AUC 0.826, accuracy 80.8{\%}. Circulating miR-21: AUC 0.653, accuracy 62.3{\%}). In addition, high ExmiR-451a was associated with mural nodules in IPMN (p = 0.010), and high ExmiR-21 was identified as a candidate prognostic factor for the overall survival (p = 0.011, HR 4.071, median OS of high-ExmiR-21: 344 days, median OS of low-ExmiR-21: 846 days) and chemo-resistant markers (p = 0.022). Conclusions: The level of three ExmiRs can thus serve as early diagnostic and progression markers of pancreatic cancer and IPMN, and considered more useful markers than the circulating miRs (limited to these three miRs).},

Multiple simultaneous measurements of plasma biomarkers can increase sensitivity and selectivity of diagnosis. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a highly sensitive technique for multiplex detection of biomarkers in plasma with little or no interfering background signal. Methods: We examined the plasma levels of 21 biomarkers in a clinically defined cohort of 52 locally advanced (Stage II/III) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases and 43 age-matched controls using a multiplex proximity ligation assay. The optimal biomarker panel for diagnosis was computed using a combination of the PAM algorithm and logistic regression modeling. Biomarkers that were significantly prognostic for survival in combination were determined using univariate and multivariate Cox survival models. Results: Three markers, CA19-9, OPN and CHI3L1, measured in multiplex were found to have superior sensitivity for pancreatic cancer vs. CA19-9 alone (93{\%} vs. 80{\%}). In addition, we identified two markers, CEA and CA125, that when measured simultaneously have prognostic significance for survival for this clinical stage of pancreatic cancer (p {\textless} 0.003).

abstract = {Background/Aims: Pancreatic cancer cells (PCC) is one of the most risky cancers and gemcitabine (GEM) is the standard first-line drug for treating PCC. The PCC will develop drug resistance to GEM after a period of treatment. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of pathogenesis and drug resistance remains unresolved. Methods: we employed qRT-PCR and western blot to examine the expression level of CXCR4, let-7a and HMGA2. In addition, we used MTT assay to detect cell proliferation and transwell assay to measure migration and invasiveness. The expression level of epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenthymal marker N-cadherin was detected by western blot. The apoptosis was determined using annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit by flow cytometry. Results: we first proved that CXCR4 negatively regulated let-7a in PCC. Next, let-7a was confirmed to play crucial role in tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells Bxpc-3 and Panc-1 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified HMGA2 as important downsteam target of let-7a in PCC and overexpression of HMGA2 restores cell proliferation, metastasis and chemosensitivity of GEM inhibited by let-7a. Conlusion: Taken together, we show an important signaling pathway involved in pathogenesis and drug resistance of PCC, thereby providing deeper insight into molecular mechanism by which CXCR4/let-7a regulates tumorigenesis and drug resistance of PCC. These findings will help us develop new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of PCC.},

abstract = {Background and aims: miRNA-124 (miR-124) expression was known to be downregulated in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Downregulation of miR-124 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Recent studies have shown that circulating miRNAs could be the potential biomarkers for invasive diagnostic as well as prognostic purposes. The purpose of the current study was to characterise the serum miR-124 levels and assess the clinical significance of serum miR-124 in patients with PDAC. Methods: Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays, serum miR-124 levels were determined in serum from 126 patients with PDAC (53 resectable pancreatic cancer and 73 unresectable pancreatic cancer), 28 chronic pancreatitis patients and 47 healthy control individuals. The prognostic significance of miR-124 and other clinicopathological variables was determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Serum miR-124 levels were significantly decreased in patients with PDAC. Serum levels of miR-124 distinguished PDAC from chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} 0.001) and healthy control subjects (P {\textless} 0.001). Low serum levels of miR-124 were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage and shorter survival time after surgery. In multivariate analysis, serum miR-124 (P = 0.001, HR: 2.47, 95{\%} CI: 1.25–4.05), high TNM stage (P = 0.001, HR = 3.24, 95{\%} CI: 2.03–8.08) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015, HR = 1.66, 95{\%} CI: 1.02–3.13) were significant predictors. Conclusions: Serum miR-124 levels have utility as diagnostic biomarkers in patients with PDAC. These findings suggest, for the first time, that serum miR-124 levels may have prognostic impact in patients with PDAC.},

abstract = {Background: Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the most lethal gastrointestinal (GI) tumor. Although many studies on differentially expressed miRNAs as candidate biomarkers of pancreatic cancer have been published, reliability of these findings generated from investigations performed in single laboratory settings remain unclear. Results: There were 29 articles with a total of 2,225 patients and 1,618 controls included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 82{\%} (95{\%} CI, 79-85{\%}); the specificity was 85{\%} (95{\%} CI, 79-89{\%}); and area under the curve (AUC) was 0.89 (95{\%} CI, 0.86-0.92). Subgroup analyses indicated that there were significant divergences between Caucasian and Asian subgroups for circulating miRNA analysis. Materials And Methods: To comprehensively investigate the potential utility of miRNAs as biomarkers of the disease, we searched publications diagnosing PaCa using miRNAs from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were used to examine the overall test performance, and heterogeneity was analyzed with the I2 test. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrated that multiple miRNAs (SEN: 85{\%}; SPE: 89{\%}; AUC: 0.93) were more accurate for diagnosing PaCa than a single miRNA (SEN: 78{\%}; SPE: 79{\%}; AUC: 0.84), and future studies are still needed to confirm the diagnostic value of these pooled miRNAs for PaCa.},

abstract = {Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, metastasis and apoptosis, and miRNA dysregulation is involved in the development of pancreatic cancer (PC). Our previous study demonstrated that Gabra3 plays critical roles in cancer progression. However, whether Gabra3 is regulated by miRNAs in PC remains unknown. Methods: The expression levels of miR-92b-3p and Gabra3 were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting, in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The proliferation rate of PC cells was detected by MTS assay. Wound-healing and transwell assays were used to examine the invasive abilities of PC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine how miR-92b-3p regulates Gabra3. Xenograft mouse models were used to assess the role of miR-92b-3p in PC tumor formation in vivo. Results: Here, we provide evidence that miR-92b-3p acted as a tumor suppressor in PC by regulating Gabra3 expression. MiR-92b-3p expression levels were lower in PC tissues than corresponding noncancerous pancreatic (CNP) tissues and were associated with a poor prognosis in PC patients. MiR-92b-3p overexpression suppressed the proliferation and invasion of PC cells in both in vivo and in vitro models. Conversely, miR-92b-3p knockdown induced an aggressive phenotype in PC cells. Mechanistically, miR-92b-3p overexpression suppressed Gabra3 expression, which then led to the inactivation of important oncogenic pathways, including the AKT/mTOR and JNK pathways. Conclusion: Our results suggest that miR-92b-3p acted as a tumor suppressor by targeting Gabra3-associated oncogenic pathways; these results provide novel insight into future treatments for PC patients.},

abstract = {Purpose: Serum-biomarker based screening for pancreatic cancer could greatly improve survival in appropriately targeted high-risk populations. Experimental Design: Eighty-three circulating proteins were analyzed in sera of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n = 333), benign pancreatic conditions (n = 144), and healthy control individuals (n = 227). Samples from each group were split randomly into training and blinded validation sets prior to analysis. A Metropolis algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation (MMC) was used to identify discriminatory biomarker panels in the training set. Identified panels were evaluated in the validation set and in patients diagnosed with colon (n = 33), lung (n = 62), and breast (n = 108) cancers. Results: Several robust profiles of protein alterations were present in sera of PDAC patients compared to the Healthy and Benign groups. In the training set (n=160 PDAC, 74 Benign, 107 Healthy), the panel of CA 19-9, ICAM-1, and OPG discriminated PDAC patients from Healthy controls with a sensitivity/specificity (SN/SP) of 88/90{\%}, while the panel of CA 19-9, CEA, and TIMP-1 discriminated PDAC patients from Benign subjects with an SN/SP of 76/90{\%}. In an independent validation set (n=173 PDAC, 70 Benign, 120 Healthy), the panel of CA 19-9, ICAM-1 and OPG demonstrated an SN/SP of 78/94{\%} while the panel of CA19-9, CEA, and TIMP-1 demonstrated an SN/SP of 71/89{\%}. The CA19-9, ICAM-1, OPGpanel is selective for PDAC and does not recognize breast (SP = 100{\%}), lung (SP = 97{\%}), or colon (SP = 97{\%}) cancer. Conclusions: The PDAC-specific biomarker panels identified in this investigation warrant additional clinical validation to determine their role in screening targeted high-risk populations. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

abstract = {Accidental radiation exposure is a threat to human health that necessitates effective clinical planning and diagnosis. Minimally invasive biomarkers that can predict long-term radiation injury are urgently needed for optimal management after a radiation accident. We have identified serum microRNA (miRNA) signatures that indicate long-term impact of total body irradiation (TBI) in mice when measured within 24 hours of exposure. Impact of TBI on the hematopoietic system was systematically assessed to determine a correlation of residual hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with increasing doses of radiation. Serum miRNA signatures distinguished untreated mice from animals exposed to radiation and correlated with the impact of radiation on HSCs. Mice exposed to sublethal (6.5 Gy) and lethal (8 Gy) doses of radiation were indistinguishable for 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. A serum miRNA signature detectable 24 hours after radiation exposure consistently segregated these two cohorts. Furthermore, using either a radioprotective agent before, or radiation mitigation after, lethal radiation, we determined that the serum miRNA signature correlated with the impact of radiation on animal health rather than the radiation dose. Last, using humanized mice that had been engrafted with human CD34+ HSCs, we determined that the serum miRNA signature indicated radiation-induced injury to the human bone marrow cells. Our data suggest that serum miRNAs can serve as functional dosimeters of radiation, representing a potential breakthrough in early assessment of radiation-induced hematopoietic damage and timely use of medical countermeasures to mitigate the long-term impact of radiation.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the diagnostic and prognostic significance of serum miR-373 in PC. METHODS: In the current study, we recruited a total of 103 PC patients, 30 patients with benign pancreatic tumor, 20 patients with chronic pancreatitis and 50 healthy volunteers. Total RNA was isolated from all the blood samples, and relative miR-373 expression levels were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that serum miR-373 expression was greatly down-regulated in PC patients. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for serum miR-373 was 0.852 for discriminating PC patients from normal control subjects. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between reduced serum miR-373 level and several clinical parameters, including TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Moreover, PC patients with lower serum miR-373 level had shorter 5 year overall survival. Finally, serum miR-373 was proved to be an independent predictor for PC. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, serum miR-373 might serve as a promising biomarker for the early detection and prognosis prediction of PC.},

abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) is one of most difficult tumors to treat. Much of this is attributed to the late diagnosis. To identify biomarkers for early detection, we examined DNA methylation differences in leukocyte DNA between PaC cases and controls in a two-phase study. In phase I, we measured methylation levels at 1,505 CpG sites in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve leukocyte DNA from 132 never-smoker PaC patients and 60 never-smoker healthy controls. We found significant differences in 110 CpG sites (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05). In phase II, we tested and validated 88 of 96 phase I selected CpG sites in 240 PaC cases and 240 matched controls (p≤0.05). Using penalized logistic regression, we built a prediction model consisting of five CpG sites (IL10{\_}P348, LCN2{\_}P86, ZAP70{\_}P220, AIM2{\_}P624, TAL1{\_}P817) that discriminated PaC patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.85 in phase I; 0.76 in phase II). Interestingly, one CpG site (LCN2{\_}P86) alone could discriminate resectable patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.78 in phase I; 0.74 in phase II). We also performed methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis and identified three CpG sites (AGXT{\_}P180{\_}F, ALOX12{\_}E85{\_}R, JAK3{\_}P1075{\_}R) where the methylation levels were significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05). Our results demonstrate that epigenetic variation in easily obtainable leukocyte DNA, manifested by reproducible methylation differences, may be used to detect PaC patients. The methylation differences at certain CpG sites are partially attributable to genetic variation. This study strongly supports future epigenome-wide association study using leukocyte DNA for biomarker discovery in human diseases. {\textcopyright} 2011 Pedersen et al.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy that often presents clinically at an advanced stage and that may be confused with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Conversely, CP may be misdiagnosed as PDAC leading to unwarranted pancreas resection. Therefore, early PDAC diagnosis and clear differentiation between PDAC and CP are crucial for improved care. Exosomes are circulating microvesicles whose components can serve as cancer biomarkers. We compared exosomal glypican-1 (GPC1) and microRNA levels in normal control subjects and in patients with PDAC and CP. We report that exosomal GPC1 is not diagnostic for PDAC, whereas high exosomal levels of microRNA-10b, (miR-10b), miR-21, miR-30c, and miR-181a and low miR-let7a readily differentiate PDAC from normal control and CP samples. By contrast with GPC1, elevated exosomal miR levels decreased to normal values within 24 h following PDAC resection. All 29 PDAC cases exhibited significantly elevated exosomal miR-10b and miR-30c levels, whereas 8 cases had normal or slightly increased CA 19-9 levels. Thus, our exosomal miR signature is superior to exosomal GPC1 or plasma CA 19-9 levels in establishing a diagnosis of PDAC and differentiating between PDAC and CP.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating malignant disease with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) in the progression of PC. Our results revealed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) UCA1 was overexpressed in PC tissues compared with adjacent histologically normal tissues. A downregulated level of UCA1 was also detected in five human PC cell lines (SW1990, BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, and CAPAN-1) compared with normal pancreatic duct epithelial HPDE cells. The proliferation of PC cells was inhibited after UCA1 was suppressed by a lentiviral vector. The cell apoptosis rate was largely promoted by downregulating UCA1. Further research revealed that microRNA (miRNA)-135a is a direct target of UCA1. The expression of miR-135a was decreased in PC tissues and cell lines compared with control groups. In addition, the decreased level of miR-135a was elevated by adding miR-135a mimic in SW1990 cells transfected with lncRNA UCA1. Similarly, an upregulated level of miR-135a was downregulated by adding miR-135a inhibitor in SW1990 cells transfected with UCA1 siRNA. Luciferase activity assay further confirmed the targeting relationship between UCA1 and miR-135a. Moreover, miR-135a reversed the effect of UCA1 on cell apoptosis rate and cell viability in SW1990 cells. The migration and invasion capacities of PC cells were suppressed by UCA1. siRNA was then enhanced by the miR-135a inhibitor. In vivo, UCA1 siRNA effectively suppressed tumor growth and the expression of migration markers. Taken together, our research revealed that UCA1 works as an oncogene by targeting miR-135a. The UCA1–miR-135a pathway regulated the growth and metastasis of PC, providing new insight in the treatment of PC.},

abstract = {Since Koprowski and coworkers discovered the CA 19-9 antigen 10 yr ago, it has become the most useful blood test in the diagnosis and management of patients with cancer of the pancreas. With an upper limit of normal of 37 U/ml, the assay's overall sensitivity is approximately 80{\%} and its specificity is 90{\%}. If higher cutoffs are used, the specificity rises so that, at levels greater than 1000 U/ml, the marker's specificity approaches 100{\%}. Acute cholangitis and cirrhosis are two benign conditions that might raise this assay significantly. This tumor-associated marker is also helpful in predicting unresectability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as 96{\%} of tumors that result in blood levels greater than 1000 U/ml have been found to be unresectable. After potentially curative surgery, the CA 19-9 can help prognosticate survival. Patients who normalize their CA 19-9 postoperatively live longer than those who do not. Furthermore, the assay, when used serially, predicts recurrence of disease prior to radiographic or clinical findings. The CA 19-9 is currently the 'gold' standard marker for pancreatic cancer, against which other assays in this field will be judged.},

The development of a liquid biopsy for PDAC has proven challenging due to the sparsity and variable phenotypic expression of circulating biomarkers. Here we report methods we developed for isolating specific subsets of extracellular vesicles (EV) from plasma using a novel magnetic nanopore capture technique. In addition, we present a workflow for identifying EV miRNA biomarkers using RNA sequencing and machine-learning algorithms, which we used in combination to classify distinct cancer states. Applying this approach to a mouse model of PDAC, we identified a biomarker panel of 11 EV miRNAs that could distinguish mice with PDAC from either healthy mice or those with precancerous lesions in a training set of n = 27 mice and a user-blinded validation set of n = 57 mice (88{\%} accuracy in a three-way classification). These results provide strong proof-of-concept support for the feasibility of using EV miRNA profiling and machine learning for liquid biopsy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) possesses a very poor prognosis, and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Evidence has suggested that microRNAs play important roles in cancer development and progression, the present study was designed to study the function of miR-1271 in PC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 17 patients. MiR-1271 and PDK1 expression were quantified by quantitative reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AKT/MTOR signaling activity and PDK1 protein expression were determined by Western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Luciferase assay was used to verify whether miR-1271 directly targets PDK1. RESULTS: MiR-1271 was significantly down-regulated in PC tissues compared with that in the paired normal adjacent tissue, and its expression was up-regulated dose-dependently upon cisplatin treatment in PC cells. Overexpression of miR-1271 in these cells produced a pro-apoptotic effect, similar to what caused by cisplatin treatment. Moreover, overexpression of miR-1271 inhibited AKT/MTOR signaling, which was due to the targeting relationship between miR-1271 and PDK1. Finally, knockdown of PDK1 exerted a similar effect on apoptosis to that of miR-1271 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-1271 is a potent tumor suppressor in PC, its pro-apoptotic function was partially mediated by reduced AKT/MTOR signaling. Targeting miR-1271 may represent an effective strategy for PC treatment.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly human malignant diseases and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China. Gemcitabine is the only first-line chemotherapeutic agent used for the palliative treatment of patients with PDAC, but chemo-resistance limits their efficacy. Here, we showed that miR-125a was up-regulated in chemo-resistant SW1990GZ cells when compared with SW1990 cells. Over-expression of miR-125a increased the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in SW1990 cells, while down-regulation of miR-125a in SW1990GZ cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine. By using bioinformatics analysis tool (Targetscan), the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of A20 gene was found to be a target of miR-125a. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that A20 3′UTR is a direct target of miR-125a. Over-expression of A20 in SW1990 cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine, while knockdown of A20 in SW1990 cells promoted the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine. Finally, the expression level of miR-125a in pancreatic cancer tissues from chemo-sensitive patients was significantly lower than that from chemo-resistant patients, and was inversely correlated with the A20 mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-125a promotes chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cells through targeting A20, which may provide novel therapeutic targets or molecular biomarkers for cancer therapy and improve tumor diagnosis or predictions of therapeutic responses.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease due to extensive metastatic lesions. Accumulating evidence suggests that miR-675-5p plays different roles in metastasis through the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and the mesenchymal to epithelial transitions (MET) in different cancers. ZEB1 promotes the EMT process by controlling the expression of E-cadherin and may have a reciprocal regulation with Ubiquilin1 (UBQLN1) and mir-200 family in cancer progression. In the present study, we showed that decreased expression of miR-675-5p is associated with the enhanced cell proliferation and survival of PC cells, while the increased expression of mir-675-5p shows the opposite one. The mir-675-5p could decrease the expression of mir-200 which is intermediated by ZEB1, and increase the expression of UBQLN1 gene. The mir-675-5p can increase the expression of ZEB1 mRNA, but the ZEB1 protein level was decreased. When mir-675-5p mimics and siUBQLN1 were co-transfected into the pancreatic cancer Patu8988 cells, the expression of ZEB1 protein was increased. It suggests that mir-675-5p may affect ZEB1 in a post-transcriptional level which was verified to be regulated by UBQLN1 protein. Hence, mir-675-5p regulates the progression of pancreatic cancer cells through the UBQLN1-ZEB1-mir200 pathway.},

abstract = {Background: Serum carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) is the most common tumor marker assessed in pancreatic cancer patients; nevertheless few articles have comprehensively evaluated the evidence for its utility in pancreatic cancer management. Methods: Literature search was performed using Medline with keywords "pancreatic cancer" "tumor markers" "CA 19-9" "diagnosis" "screening" "prognosis" "resectability" and "recurrence". All English language articles pertaining to the role of CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer were critically analyzed to determine its utility as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Results: Serum CA 19-9 is the most extensively validated pancreatic cancer biomarker with multiple clinical applications. CA 19-9 serum levels have a sensitivity and specificity of 79-81{\%} and 82-90{\%} respectively for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients; but are not useful as a screening marker because of low positive predictive value (0.5-0.9{\%}). Pre-operative CA 19-9 serum levels provide useful prognostic information as patients with normal levels ({\textless}37 U/mL) have a prolonged median survival (32-36 months) compared to patients with elevated levels ({\textgreater}37 U/mL) (12-15 months). A CA 19-9 serum level of {\textless}100 U/mL implies likely resectable disease whereas levels {\textgreater}100 U/mL suggest unresectablity or metastatic disease. Normalization or a decrease in post-operative CA 19-9 serum levels by ≥20-50{\%} from baseline following surgical resection or chemotherapy is associated with prolonged survival compared to failure of CA 19-9 serum levels to normalize or an increase. Important limitations to CA 19-9 serum level evaluation in pancreatic cancer include poor sensitivity, false negative results in Lewis negative phenotype (5-10{\%}) and increased false positivity in the presence of obstructive jaundice (10-60{\%}). Conclusions: CA 19-9 is the most extensively studied and validated serum biomarker for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients. CA 19-9 serum levels can provide important information with regards to prognosis, overall survival, and response to chemotherapy as well as predict post-operative recurrence. However, non-specific expression in several benign and malignant diseases, false negative results in Lewis negative genotype and an increased false positive results in the presence of obstructive jaundice severely limit the universal applicability of serum CA 19-9 levels in pancreatic cancer management. {\textcopyright} Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.},

Levels of GPC1+ crExos correlate with tumour burden and the survival of pre- and post-surgical patients. GPC1+ crExos from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging.

We conducted a nested case-control study within the Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort to evaluate prediagnostic microRNAs (miRs) as biomarkers of subsequent PDAC risk. A panel of eight miRs (miR-10a, -10b, -21-3p, -21-5p, -30c, -106b, -155 and -212) based on previous evidence from our group was evaluated in 225 microscopically confirmed PDAC cases and 225 controls matched on center, sex, fasting status and age/date/time of blood collection. MiR levels in prediagnostic plasma samples were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Logistic regression was used to model levels and PDAC risk, adjusting for covariates and to estimate area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Plasma miR-10b, -21-5p, -30c and -106b levels were significantly higher in cases diagnosed within 2 years of blood collection compared to matched controls (all p-values {\textless}0.04). Based on adjusted logistic regression models, levels for six miRs (miR-10a, -10b, -21-5p, -30c, -155 and -212) overall, and for four miRs (-10a, -10b, -21-5p and -30c) at shorter follow-up time between blood collection and diagnosis (≤5 yr, ≤2 yr), were statistically significantly associated with risk. A score based on the panel showed a linear dose-response trend with risk (p-value = 0.0006). For shorter follow-up (≤5 yr), AUC for the score was 0.73, and for individual miRs ranged from 0.73 (miR-212) to 0.79 (miR-21-5p).},

abstract = {Background: Risk of normal tissue toxicity limits the amount of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) that can be routinely prescribed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An early biomarker of response to thoracic RT may provide a way to predict eventual toxicities-such as radiation pneumonitis-during treatment, thereby enabling dose adjustment before the symptomatic onset of late effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were studied as potential serological biomarkers for thoracic RT. As a first step, we sought to identify miRNAs that correlate with delivered dose and standard dosimetric factors. Methods: We performed miRNA profiling of plasma samples obtained from five patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC at five dose-points each during radical thoracic RT. Candidate miRNAs were then assessed in samples from a separate cohort of 21 NSCLC patients receiving radical thoracic RT. To identify a cellular source of circulating miRNAs, we quantified in vitro miRNA expression intracellularly and within secreted exosomes in five NSCLC and stromal cell lines. Results: miRNA profiling of the discovery cohort identified ten circulating miRNAs that correlated with delivered RT dose as well as other dosimetric parameters such as lung V20. In the validation cohort, miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were reproducibly shown to decrease with increasing radiation dose. Expression of miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p in secreted exosomes decreased with radiation. This was concomitant with an increase in intracellular levels, suggesting that exosomal export of these miRNAs may be downregulated in both NSCLC and stromal cells in response to radiation. Conclusions: miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were identified as circulating biomarkers that correlated with delivered RT dose. miR-150 has been reported to decrease in the circulation of mammals exposed to radiation while miR-29a has been associated with fibrosis in the human heart, lungs, and kidneys. One may therefore hypothesize that outlier levels of circulating miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p may eventually help predict unexpected responses to radiation therapy, such as toxicity.},

abstract = {Background and Aim: Although the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is generally poor, it is well known that the survival rate for resected pancreatic cancer is much higher than that for more conservative treatment. The importance of early detection is emphasized for resection of pancreatic cancer. Measurement of serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 has shown satisfactory sensitivity and predictive value in symptomatic patients, but no available data has been found on healthy asymptomatic subjects. Thus, the authors aimed to determine the clinical usefulness of CA 19-9 as a screening tool for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic subjects. Methods: From December 1994 to November 2000, 70 940 asymptomatic persons visiting the Health Promotion Center at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, participated. All subjects underwent abdominal ultrasonography and serum CA 19-9 measurement. The authors analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of CA 19-9 for detecting pancreatic cancer. Also, those subjects who had a serum CA 19-9 level above the cut-off value were followed up using a serial check of CA 19-9, computed tomography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Results: The number of subjects with a level of CA 19-9 above the cutoff of 37 U/mL was 1063 (1.5{\%}), including four cases diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The prevalence of pancreatic cancer over the age of 30 years is 13.66 per 100 000 population in Korea. Therefore, the sensitivity is 100{\%} and the specificity 98.5{\%}. However, the positive predictive value of CA 19-9 for detecting pancreatic cancer is only 0.9{\%} in the asymptomatic population. Conclusion: Mass screening for pancreatic cancer using CA 19-9 levels in asymptomatic subjects is ineffective because of a very low positive predictive value, despite its high sensitivity and specificity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

Recently, GPC1 circulating exosomes (crExos) have been shown to be able to detect early stages of PDAC. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of crExos GPC1 as a biomarker for PDAC. Methods: Plasma was obtained from patients with benign pancreatic disease (n = 16) and PDAC (n = 27) prior to pancreatectomy, and crExos were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. Protein was extracted from surgical specimens (adjacent normal pancreas, n = 13; and PDAC, n = 17). GPC1 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: There was no significant difference in GPC1 levels between normal pancreas and PDAC tissues. This was also true when comparing matched pairs. However, GPC1 levels were enriched in PDAC crExos (n = 11), compared to the source tumors (n = 11; 97 ± 54 vs. 20.9 ± 12.3 pg/mL; P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, PDACs with high GPC1 expression tended to have crExos with higher GPC1 levels. Despite these findings, we were unable to distinguish PDAC from benign pancreatic disease using crExos GPC1 levels. Interestingly, we found that in matched pre and post-operative plasma samples there was a significant drop in crExos GPC1 levels after surgical resection for PDAC (n = 11 vs. 11; 97 ± 54 vs. 77.8 ± 32.4 pg/mL; P = 0.0428). Furthermore, we found that patients with high crExos GPC1 levels have significantly larger PDACs ( {\textgreater} 4 cm; P = 0.012). Conclusions: High GPC1 crExos may be able to determine PDAC tumor size and disease burden. However, further efforts are needed to elucidate its role as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker using larger cohorts of PDAC patients.},

abstract = {Effective planning for the medical response to a radiological or nuclear accident is complex. Because of limited resources for medical countermeasures, the key would be to accurately triage and identify victims most likely to benefit from treatment. We used a mouse model system to provide evidence that serum microRNAs (miRNAs) may effectively predict the impact of radiation on the long-term viability of animals. We had previously used nonhuman primates (NHPs) to demonstrate that this concept is conserved and serum miRNA signatures have the potential to serve as prediction biomarkers for radiation-induced fatality in a human population. We identified a signature of seven miRNAs that are altered by irradiation in both mice and NHPs. Genomic analysis of these conserved miRNAs revealed that there is a combination of seven transcription factors that are predicted to regulate these miRNAs in human, mice, and NHPs. Moreover, a combination of three miRNAs (miR-133b, miR-215, and miR-375) can identify, with nearly complete accuracy, NHPs exposed to radiation versus unexposed NHPs. Consistent with historical data, female macaques appeared to be more sensitive to radiation, but the difference was not significant. Sex-based stratification allowed us to identify an interaction between gender and miR-16-2 expression, which affected the outcome of radiation exposure. Moreover, we developed a classifier based on two miRNAs (miR-30a and miR-126) that can reproducibly predict radiation-induced mortality. Together, we have obtained a five-miRNA composite signature that can identify irradiated macaques and predict their probability of survival.},

The exploration of novel non-invasive biomarkers will definitely benefit PC patients. Recently, circulating miRNAs in body fluids are emerging as non-invasive biomarkers for PC diagnosis. In this study, we first conducted comprehensive robust rank aggregation (RRA) analysis based on 21 published miRome profiling studies. We statistically identified and clinically validated a miRNA expression pattern in PC patients. These miRNAs consisted of four up-regulated (hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-155-5p) and three down-regulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-217, hsa-miR-148a-3p and hsa-miR-375). Among them, hsa-miR-21-5p was one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in the serum of PC patients. Our validation test further suggested a relatively high accuracy of serum hsa-miR-21-5p levels in the diagnosis of PC, with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.80. Finally, a diagnostic meta-analysis based on 9 studies also revealed favorable sensitivity and specificity of circulating hsa-miR-21-5p for the diagnosis of PC (pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 and 0.74, respectively), which was consistent with our findings. Taken together, as one of the most aberrantly expressed miRNAs in PC, circulating hsa-miR-21-5p might be a promising serum biomarker in patients with PC.},

However, the role of microRNA-195 in pancreatic cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we show that microRNA-195 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell line. Also, we show that overexpression of microRNA-195 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, whereas suppression of microRNA-195 promotes proliferation and invasion. We show that microRNA-195 directly targets the fatty acid synthase enzyme and negatively regulates the expression of fatty acid synthase. Also, we show that fatty acid synthase expression is inversely correlated with microRNA-195 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues. Moreover, our results show that microRNA-195 inhibits Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. By restoring fatty acid synthase expression, we were able to reverse the antitumor effects of microRNA-195 in pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, our findings show that microRNA-195 inhibits pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the fatty acid synthase/Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting a tumor suppressive role for microRNA-195 in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. Thus, inhibiting fatty acid synthase by microRNA-195 may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is an increasingly well-understood concept that explains much of the contribution of an organism's environment and experience to its biology. However, discussion persists as to which mechanisms can be classified as epigenetic. Ongoing research continues to uncover novel pathways, including the important role of non-protein coding RNA transcripts in epigenetic gene regulation. We know that the majority of human and other mammalian transcripts are not translated but that many of these are nonetheless functional. These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be short ({\textless} 200 nt) or long ({\textless} 200 nt) and are further classified by genomic origin and mechanism of action. We discuss examples of ncRNAs that interact with histone modifying complexes or DNA methyltransferases to regulate gene expression, others that are targets of these epigenetic mechanisms, and propose a model in which such transcripts feed back into an epigenetic regulatory network. {\textcopyright} 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Circulating miRNAs are promising biomarkers in oncology but have not yet been implemented in the clinic given the lack of concordance across studies. In order to increase the cross-studies reliability, we attempted to reduce and to control the circulating miRNA expression variability between patients. First, to maximize profiling signals and to reduce miRNA expression variability, three isolation kits were compared and the NucleoSpin{\textregistered} kit provided higher miRNA concentrations than the other widely used kits. Second, to control inter-sample variability during the profiling step, the exogenous miRNAs normalization method commonly used for RT-qPCR validation step was adapted to microarray experiments. Importantly, exogenous miRNAs presented two-fold lower inter-sample variability than the widely used endogenous miR-16-5p reflecting that the latter is subject to both biological and technical variability. Although Caenorhabditis elegans miRNAs isolation yields were heterogeneous, they correlated to each other and to their geometrical mean across samples. The normalization based on the geometrical mean of three exogenous miRNAs increased the correlation up-to 0.97 between the microarrays and individual RT-qPCR steps of circulating miRNAs expression. Overall, this new strategy open new avenue to identify reliable circulating miRNA signatures for translation into clinical practice.},

abstract = {Cumulative evidence from biological experiments has confirmed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are related to many types of human diseases through different biological processes. It is anticipated that precise miRNA-disease association prediction could not only help infer potential disease-related miRNA but also boost human diagnosis and disease prevention. Considering the limitations of previous computational models, a more effective computational model needs to be implemented to predict miRNA-disease associations. In this work, we first constructed a human miRNA-miRNA similarity network utilizing miRNA-miRNA functional similarity data and heterogeneous miRNA Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarities based on the assumption that similar miRNAs with similar functions tend to be associated with similar diseases, and vice versa. Then, we constructed disease-disease similarity using disease semantic information and heterogeneous disease-related interaction data. We proposed a deep ensemble model called DeepMDA that extracts high-level features from similarity information using stacked autoencoders and then predicts miRNA-disease associations by adopting a 3-layer neural network. In addition to five-fold cross-validation, we also proposed another cross-validation method to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that the proposed model is superior to previous methods with high robustness.},

abstract = {Background: Gene expression is a key intermediate level that genotypes lead to a particular trait. Gene expression is affected by various factors including genotypes of genetic variants. With an aim of delineating the genetic impact on gene expression, we build a deep auto-encoder model to assess how good genetic variants will contribute to gene expression changes. This new deep learning model is a regression-based predictive model based on the MultiLayer Perceptron and Stacked Denoising Auto-encoder (MLP-SAE). The model is trained using a stacked denoising auto-encoder for feature selection and a multilayer perceptron framework for backpropagation. We further improve the model by introducing dropout to prevent overfitting and improve performance. Results: To demonstrate the usage of this model, we apply MLP-SAE to a real genomic datasets with genotypes and gene expression profiles measured in yeast. Our results show that the MLP-SAE model with dropout outperforms other models including Lasso, Random Forests and the MLP-SAE model without dropout. Using the MLP-SAE model with dropout, we show that gene expression quantifications predicted by the model solely based on genotypes, align well with true gene expression patterns. Conclusion: We provide a deep auto-encoder model for predicting gene expression from SNP genotypes. This study demonstrates that deep learning is appropriate for tackling another genomic problem, i.e., building predictive models to understand genotypes' contribution to gene expression. With the emerging availability of richer genomic data, we anticipate that deep learning models play a bigger role in modeling and interpreting genomics.},

abstract = {Cancer diagnosis is currently undergoing a paradigm shift with the incorporation of molecular biomarkers as part of routine diagnostic panel. This breakthrough discovery directs researches to examine the role of microRNA in cancer, since its deregulation is often associated with almost all human tumors. Such differences frequently recur in tumor-specific microRNA signatures, which are helpful to diagnose tissue of origin and tumor subtypes. Nonetheless, the resulting classification problem is far from trivial, as there are hundreds of microRNA types, and tumors are non-linearly correlated to the presence of several overexpressions. In this paper, we propose to apply an evolutionary optimized convolutional neural network classifier to this complex task. The presented approach is compared against 21 state-of-the-art classifiers, on a real-world dataset featuring 8129 patients, for 29 different classes of tumors, using 1046 different biomarkers. As a result of the comparison, we also present a meta-analysis on the dataset, identifying the classes on which the collective performance of the considered classifiers is less effective, and thus possibly singling out types of tumors for which biomarker tests might be less reliable.},

abstract = {Investigating how genes jointly affect complex human diseases is important, yet challenging. The network approach (e.g., weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)) is a powerful tool. However, genomic data usually contain substantial batch effects, which could mask true genomic signals. Paired design is a powerful tool that can reduce batch effects. However, it is currently unclear how to appropriately apply WGCNA to genomic data from paired design. In this paper, we modified the current WGCNA pipeline to analyse high-throughput genomic data from paired design. We illustrated the modified WGCNA pipeline by analysing the miRNA dataset provided by Shiah et al. (2014), which contains forty oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens and their matched non-tumourous epithelial counterparts. OSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The modified WGCNA pipeline identified two sets of novel miRNAs associated with OSCC, in addition to the existing miRNAs reported by Shiah et al. (2014). Thus, this work will be of great interest to readers of various scientific disciplines, in particular, genetic and genomic scientists as well as medical scientists working on cancer.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) under transcriptional control of the HNF1$\beta$ transcription factor, and investigate whether its effect manifests in serum. Methods: The Polish cohort (N = 60) consisted of 11 patients with HNF1B-MODY, 17 with HNF1A-MODY, 13 with GCK-MODY, an HbA1c-matched type 1 diabetic group (n = 9) and ten healthy controls. Replication was performed in 61 clinically-matched British patients mirroring the groups in the Polish cohort. The Polish cohort underwent miRNA serum level profiling with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) arrays to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Validation was performed using qPCR. To determine whether serum content reflects alterations at a cellular level, we quantified miRNA levels in a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) with small interfering RNA knockdowns of HNF1$\alpha$ or HNF1$\beta$. Results: Significant differences (adjusted p {\textless} 0.05) were noted for 11 miRNAs. Five of them differed between HNF1A-MODY and HNF1B-MODY, and, amongst those, four (miR-24, miR-27b, miR-223 and miR-199a) showed HNF1B-MODY-specific expression levels in the replication group. In all four cases the miRNA expression level was lower in HNF1B-MODY than in all other tested groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.79 to 0.86, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 91.7{\%} (miR-24) and 82.1{\%} (miR-199a), respectively. The cellular expression pattern of miRNA was consistent with serum levels, as all were significantly higher in HNF1$\alpha$- than in HNF1$\beta$-deficient HepG2 cells. Conclusions/interpretation: We have shown that expression of specific miRNAs depends on HNF1$\beta$ function. The impact of HNF1$\beta$ deficiency was evidenced at serum level, making HNF1$\beta$-dependent miRNAs potentially applicable in the diagnosis of HNF1B-MODY.},

With an upper limit of normal of 37 U/ml, the assay's overall sensitivity is approximately 80{\%} and its specificity is 90{\%}. If higher cutoffs are used, the specificity rises so that, at levels greater than 1000 U/ml, the marker's specificity approaches 100{\%}. Acute cholangitis and cirrhosis are two benign conditions that might raise this assay significantly. This tumor-associated marker is also helpful in predicting unresectability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as 96{\%} of tumors that result in blood levels greater than 1000 U/ml have been found to be unresectable. After potentially curative surgery, the CA 19-9 can help prognosticate survival. Patients who normalize their CA 19-9 postoperatively live longer than those who do not. Furthermore, the assay, when used serially, predicts recurrence of disease prior to radiographic or clinical findings.

abstract = {Background: Risk of normal tissue toxicity limits the amount of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) that can be routinely prescribed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An early biomarker of response to thoracic RT may provide a way to predict eventual toxicities-such as radiation pneumonitis-during treatment, thereby enabling dose adjustment before the symptomatic onset of late effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were studied as potential serological biomarkers for thoracic RT. As a first step, we sought to identify miRNAs that correlate with delivered dose and standard dosimetric factors. Methods: We performed miRNA profiling of plasma samples obtained from five patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC at five dose-points each during radical thoracic RT. Candidate miRNAs were then assessed in samples from a separate cohort of 21 NSCLC patients receiving radical thoracic RT. To identify a cellular source of circulating miRNAs, we quantified in vitro miRNA expression intracellularly and within secreted exosomes in five NSCLC and stromal cell lines. Results: miRNA profiling of the discovery cohort identified ten circulating miRNAs that correlated with delivered RT dose as well as other dosimetric parameters such as lung V20. In the validation cohort, miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were reproducibly shown to decrease with increasing radiation dose. Expression of miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p in secreted exosomes decreased with radiation. This was concomitant with an increase in intracellular levels, suggesting that exosomal export of these miRNAs may be downregulated in both NSCLC and stromal cells in response to radiation. Conclusions: miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were identified as circulating biomarkers that correlated with delivered RT dose. miR-150 has been reported to decrease in the circulation of mammals exposed to radiation while miR-29a has been associated with fibrosis in the human heart, lungs, and kidneys. One may therefore hypothesize that outlier levels of circulating miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p may eventually help predict unexpected responses to radiation therapy, such as toxicity.},

abstract = {Accidental radiation exposure is a threat to human health that necessitates effective clinical planning and diagnosis. Minimally invasive biomarkers that can predict long-term radiation injury are urgently needed for optimal management after a radiation accident. We have identified serum microRNA (miRNA) signatures that indicate long-term impact of total body irradiation (TBI) in mice when measured within 24 hours of exposure. Impact of TBI on the hematopoietic system was systematically assessed to determine a correlation of residual hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with increasing doses of radiation. Serum miRNA signatures distinguished untreated mice from animals exposed to radiation and correlated with the impact of radiation on HSCs. Mice exposed to sublethal (6.5 Gy) and lethal (8 Gy) doses of radiation were indistinguishable for 3 to 4 weeks after exposure. A serum miRNA signature detectable 24 hours after radiation exposure consistently segregated these two cohorts. Furthermore, using either a radioprotective agent before, or radiation mitigation after, lethal radiation, we determined that the serum miRNA signature correlated with the impact of radiation on animal health rather than the radiation dose. Last, using humanized mice that had been engrafted with human CD34+ HSCs, we determined that the serum miRNA signature indicated radiation-induced injury to the human bone marrow cells. Our data suggest that serum miRNAs can serve as functional dosimeters of radiation, representing a potential breakthrough in early assessment of radiation-induced hematopoietic damage and timely use of medical countermeasures to mitigate the long-term impact of radiation.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (≥ 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},

abstract = {Effective planning for the medical response to a radiological or nuclear accident is complex. Because of limited resources for medical countermeasures, the key would be to accurately triage and identify victims most likely to benefit from treatment. We used a mouse model system to provide evidence that serum microRNAs (miRNAs) may effectively predict the impact of radiation on the long-term viability of animals. We had previously used nonhuman primates (NHPs) to demonstrate that this concept is conserved and serum miRNA signatures have the potential to serve as prediction biomarkers for radiation-induced fatality in a human population. We identified a signature of seven miRNAs that are altered by irradiation in both mice and NHPs. Genomic analysis of these conserved miRNAs revealed that there is a combination of seven transcription factors that are predicted to regulate these miRNAs in human, mice, and NHPs. Moreover, a combination of three miRNAs (miR-133b, miR-215, and miR-375) can identify, with nearly complete accuracy, NHPs exposed to radiation versus unexposed NHPs. Consistent with historical data, female macaques appeared to be more sensitive to radiation, but the difference was not significant. Sex-based stratification allowed us to identify an interaction between gender and miR-16-2 expression, which affected the outcome of radiation exposure. Moreover, we developed a classifier based on two miRNAs (miR-30a and miR-126) that can reproducibly predict radiation-induced mortality. Together, we have obtained a five-miRNA composite signature that can identify irradiated macaques and predict their probability of survival.},

abstract = {The efficacy of radiotherapy in many tumor types is limited by normal tissue toxicity and by intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular network responsible for regulating radiosensitivity/resistance. Here, an unbiased functional screen identified four microRNAs (miR1, miR125a, miR150, and miR425) that induce radioresistance. Considering the clinical importance of radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma, the impact of these miRNAs on glioblastoma radioresistance was investigated. Overexpression of miR1, miR125a, miR150, and/or miR425 in glioblastoma promotes radioresistance through upregulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint response. Conversely, antagonizing with antagomiRs sensitizes glioblastoma cells to irradiation, suggesting their potential as targets for inhibiting therapeutic resistance. Analysis of glioblastoma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that these miRNAs are expressed in glioblastoma patient specimens and correlate with TGFb signaling. Finally, it is demonstrated that expression of miR1 and miR125a can be induced by TGFb and antagonized by a TGFb receptor inhibitor. Together, these results identify and characterize a new role for miR425, miR1, miR125, and miR150 in promoting radioresistance in glioblastomas and provide insight into the therapeutic application of TGFb inhibitors in radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease due to extensive metastatic lesions. Accumulating evidence suggests that miR-675-5p plays different roles in metastasis through the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and the mesenchymal to epithelial transitions (MET) in different cancers. ZEB1 promotes the EMT process by controlling the expression of E-cadherin and may have a reciprocal regulation with Ubiquilin1 (UBQLN1) and mir-200 family in cancer progression. In the present study, we showed that decreased expression of miR-675-5p is associated with the enhanced cell proliferation and survival of PC cells, while the increased expression of mir-675-5p shows the opposite one. The mir-675-5p could decrease the expression of mir-200 which is intermediated by ZEB1, and increase the expression of UBQLN1 gene. The mir-675-5p can increase the expression of ZEB1 mRNA, but the ZEB1 protein level was decreased. When mir-675-5p mimics and siUBQLN1 were co-transfected into the pancreatic cancer Patu8988 cells, the expression of ZEB1 protein was increased. It suggests that mir-675-5p may affect ZEB1 in a post-transcriptional level which was verified to be regulated by UBQLN1 protein. Hence, mir-675-5p regulates the progression of pancreatic cancer cells through the UBQLN1-ZEB1-mir200 pathway.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating malignant disease with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) in the progression of PC. Our results revealed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) UCA1 was overexpressed in PC tissues compared with adjacent histologically normal tissues. A downregulated level of UCA1 was also detected in five human PC cell lines (SW1990, BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, and CAPAN-1) compared with normal pancreatic duct epithelial HPDE cells. The proliferation of PC cells was inhibited after UCA1 was suppressed by a lentiviral vector. The cell apoptosis rate was largely promoted by downregulating UCA1. Further research revealed that microRNA (miRNA)-135a is a direct target of UCA1. The expression of miR-135a was decreased in PC tissues and cell lines compared with control groups. In addition, the decreased level of miR-135a was elevated by adding miR-135a mimic in SW1990 cells transfected with lncRNA UCA1. Similarly, an upregulated level of miR-135a was downregulated by adding miR-135a inhibitor in SW1990 cells transfected with UCA1 siRNA. Luciferase activity assay further confirmed the targeting relationship between UCA1 and miR-135a. Moreover, miR-135a reversed the effect of UCA1 on cell apoptosis rate and cell viability in SW1990 cells. The migration and invasion capacities of PC cells were suppressed by UCA1. siRNA was then enhanced by the miR-135a inhibitor. In vivo, UCA1 siRNA effectively suppressed tumor growth and the expression of migration markers. Taken together, our research revealed that UCA1 works as an oncogene by targeting miR-135a. The UCA1–miR-135a pathway regulated the growth and metastasis of PC, providing new insight in the treatment of PC.},

abstract = {Treatment of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine (GEM) is limited due to its rapid plasma metabolism and development of chemoresistance. MicroRNA (miRNA) regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and induces chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this study, we observed differential downregulation of miR-205 (miR-205-5p) in human pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Compared to GEM-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells, miR-205 was highly downregulated in GEM-resistant MIA PaCa-2R cells. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-205 inhibits MIA PaCa-2R cell proliferation after GEM-treatment. Further investigation confirmed that miR-205 alone significantly reduces the proliferation of CSCs and tumor growth in mouse models. However, miR-205 in combination with GEM was more efficient in reducing the proliferation of CSCs and 3D spheroids. Moreover, miR-205 overexpressing MIA PaCa-2R cells induced orthotopic tumor growth was significantly inhibited after intravenous administration of GEM-conjugated methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate)-graft-gemcitabine-graft-dodecanol (mPEG-b-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC) (mPEG-b-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC) polymeric micelles. Also, a reduction in CSCs, EMT and chemoresistance markers was observed in miR-205 overexpressing MIA PaCa-2R cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of orthotopic tumors showed a decrease in drug resistance protein caveolin-1 and cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in combination treatment. Overall, our findings suggest that miR-205 resensitizes GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells to GEM and acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA.},

The PCC will develop drug resistance to GEM after a period of treatment. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of pathogenesis and drug resistance remains unresolved. Methods: we employed qRT-PCR and western blot to examine the expression level of CXCR4, let-7a and HMGA2. In addition, we used MTT assay to detect cell proliferation and transwell assay to measure migration and invasiveness. The expression level of epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenthymal marker N-cadherin was detected by western blot.

Next, let-7a was confirmed to play crucial role in tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells Bxpc-3 and Panc-1 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified HMGA2 as important downsteam target of let-7a in PCC and overexpression of HMGA2 restores cell proliferation, metastasis and chemosensitivity of GEM inhibited by let-7a.

Here, we showed that miR-125a was up-regulated in chemo-resistant SW1990GZ cells when compared with SW1990 cells. Over-expression of miR-125a increased the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in SW1990 cells, while down-regulation of miR-125a in SW1990GZ cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine. By using bioinformatics analysis tool (Targetscan), the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of A20 gene was found to be a target of miR-125a. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that A20 3′UTR is a direct target of miR-125a. Over-expression of A20 in SW1990 cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine, while knockdown of A20 in SW1990 cells promoted the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine. Finally, the expression level of miR-125a in pancreatic cancer tissues from chemo-sensitive patients was significantly lower than that from chemo-resistant patients, and was inversely correlated with the A20 mRNA levels.

Our previous study demonstrated that Gabra3 plays critical roles in cancer progression. However, whether Gabra3 is regulated by miRNAs in PC remains unknown. Methods: The expression levels of miR-92b-3p and Gabra3 were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting, in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The proliferation rate of PC cells was detected by MTS assay. Wound-healing and transwell assays were used to examine the invasive abilities of PC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine how miR-92b-3p regulates Gabra3. Xenograft mouse models were used to assess the role of miR-92b-3p in PC tumor formation in vivo. Results: Here, we provide evidence that miR-92b-3p acted as a tumor suppressor in PC by regulating Gabra3 expression. MiR-92b-3p expression levels were lower in PC tissues than corresponding noncancerous pancreatic (CNP) tissues and were associated with a poor prognosis in PC patients. MiR-92b-3p overexpression suppressed the proliferation and invasion of PC cells in both in vivo and in vitro models. Conversely, miR-92b-3p knockdown induced an aggressive phenotype in PC cells. Mechanistically, miR-92b-3p overexpression suppressed Gabra3 expression, which then led to the inactivation of important oncogenic pathways, including the AKT/mTOR and JNK pathways. Conclusion: Our results suggest that miR-92b-3p acted as a tumor suppressor by targeting Gabra3-associated oncogenic pathways; these results provide novel insight into future treatments for PC patients.},

Evidence has suggested that microRNAs play important roles in cancer development and progression, the present study was designed to study the function of miR-1271 in PC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 17 patients. MiR-1271 and PDK1 expression were quantified by quantitative reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AKT/MTOR signaling activity and PDK1 protein expression were determined by Western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Luciferase assay was used to verify whether miR-1271 directly targets PDK1. RESULTS: MiR-1271 was significantly down-regulated in PC tissues compared with that in the paired normal adjacent tissue, and its expression was up-regulated dose-dependently upon cisplatin treatment in PC cells. Overexpression of miR-1271 in these cells produced a pro-apoptotic effect, similar to what caused by cisplatin treatment. Moreover, overexpression of miR-1271 inhibited AKT/MTOR signaling, which was due to the targeting relationship between miR-1271 and PDK1. Finally, knockdown of PDK1 exerted a similar effect on apoptosis to that of miR-1271 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-1271 is a potent tumor suppressor in PC, its pro-apoptotic function was partially mediated by reduced AKT/MTOR signaling. Targeting miR-1271 may represent an effective strategy for PC treatment.},

The significance of serum microRNA (miR) levels in pancreatic neoplasm such as pancreatic cancer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) diagnosis remains unclear. We herein evaluated the usefulness of miRs enclosed in serum exosomes (ExmiRs) as diagnostic markers. Methods: The ExmiRs from patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 32) or IPMN (n = 29), and patients without neoplasms (controls; n = 22) were enriched using ExoQuick-TC™. The expression of ExmiRs was evaluated using a next-generation sequencing analysis, and the selected three miRs through this analysis were confirmed by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The expression of ExmiR-191, ExmiR-21 and ExmiR-451a was significantly up-regulated in patients with pancreatic cancer and IPMN compared to the controls (p {\textless} 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve and the diagnostic accuracy of ExmiRs were 5-20{\%} superior to those of three serum bulky circulating miRs (e.g.; ExmiR-21: AUC 0.826, accuracy 80.8{\%}. Circulating miR-21: AUC 0.653, accuracy 62.3{\%}). In addition, high ExmiR-451a was associated with mural nodules in IPMN (p = 0.010), and high ExmiR-21 was identified as a candidate prognostic factor for the overall survival (p = 0.011, HR 4.071, median OS of high-ExmiR-21: 344 days, median OS of low-ExmiR-21: 846 days) and chemo-resistant markers (p = 0.022). Conclusions: The level of three ExmiRs can thus serve as early diagnostic and progression markers of pancreatic cancer and IPMN, and considered more useful markers than the circulating miRs (limited to these three miRs).},

abstract = {Improved diagnostics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to detect the disease at earlier, curative stages and to guide treatments is crucial to progress against this disease. The development of a liquid biopsy for PDAC has proven challenging due to the sparsity and variable phenotypic expression of circulating biomarkers. Here we report methods we developed for isolating specific subsets of extracellular vesicles (EV) from plasma using a novel magnetic nanopore capture technique. In addition, we present a workflow for identifying EV miRNA biomarkers using RNA sequencing and machine-learning algorithms, which we used in combination to classify distinct cancer states. Applying this approach to a mouse model of PDAC, we identified a biomarker panel of 11 EV miRNAs that could distinguish mice with PDAC from either healthy mice or those with precancerous lesions in a training set of n = 27 mice and a user-blinded validation set of n = 57 mice (88{\%} accuracy in a three-way classification). These results provide strong proof-of-concept support for the feasibility of using EV miRNA profiling and machine learning for liquid biopsy. Significance: These findings present a panel of extracellular vesicle miRNA blood-based biomarkers that can detect pancreatic cancer at a precancerous stage in a transgenic mousemodel.},

abstract = {Objectives Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers, and its diagnosis often requires invasive procedures. Deregulated miRNA expression has been described in patients with PDAC. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of 6 miRNAs (miR-21, -34a, -155, -196a, -200b, and -376a involved in PDAC tumorigenesis) in serum and salivary samples to assess their potential role as circulating diagnostics biomarkers. Methods Serum and salivary samples were collected from patients with PDAC and healthy controls, and miRNA levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Twenty-four patients with PDAC and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Results A significant difference between PDAC and healthy groups was observed for the expression of miR-21 and miR-34a (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.001) in serum samples. Both miRNAs accurately discriminated between the 2 groups, with an area under the curve for miR-21 and miR-34a of 0.889 (P = 0.001) and 0.865 (P = 0.002), respectively. In general, the expression of miRNAs between salivary samples did not differ. Conclusions Serum miR-21 and miR-34a are potentially useful diagnostic biomarkers of PDAC. In addition, our results suggest that these miRNAs are not differentially expressed in saliva, making them unsuitable for use as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.},

abstract = {Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease. Novel biomarkers are required to aid treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potentially ideal diagnostic biomarkers, as they are stable molecules, and tumour and tissue specific. Results: Logistic regression analysis revealed an endoscopic-ultrasound fineneedle aspiration (EUS-FNA) 2-miRNA classifier (miR-21 + miR-155) capable of distinguishing benign from malignant pancreatic lesions with a sensitivity of 81.5{\%} and a specificity of 85.7{\%} (AUC 0.930). Validation FNA cohorts confirmed both miRNAs were overexpressed in malignant disease, while circulating miRNAs performed poorly. Methods: Fifty-five patients with a suspicious pancreatic lesion on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated by EUS-FNA. At echo-endoscopy, the first part of the FNA was sent for cytological assessment and the second part was used for total RNA extraction. Candidate miRNAs were selected after careful review of the literature and expression was quantified by qRT-PCR. Validation was performed on an independent cohort of EUS-FNAs, as well as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and plasma samples. Conclusions: We provide further evidence for using miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic malignancy. We demonstrate the feasibility of using fresh EUS-FNAs to establish miRNA-based signatures unique to pancreatic malignant transformation and the potential to enhance risk stratification and selection for surgery.},

abstract = {Background and aims: miRNA-124 (miR-124) expression was known to be downregulated in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Downregulation of miR-124 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Recent studies have shown that circulating miRNAs could be the potential biomarkers for invasive diagnostic as well as prognostic purposes. The purpose of the current study was to characterise the serum miR-124 levels and assess the clinical significance of serum miR-124 in patients with PDAC. Methods: Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays, serum miR-124 levels were determined in serum from 126 patients with PDAC (53 resectable pancreatic cancer and 73 unresectable pancreatic cancer), 28 chronic pancreatitis patients and 47 healthy control individuals. The prognostic significance of miR-124 and other clinicopathological variables was determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Serum miR-124 levels were significantly decreased in patients with PDAC. Serum levels of miR-124 distinguished PDAC from chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} 0.001) and healthy control subjects (P {\textless} 0.001). Low serum levels of miR-124 were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage and shorter survival time after surgery. In multivariate analysis, serum miR-124 (P = 0.001, HR: 2.47, 95{\%} CI: 1.25–4.05), high TNM stage (P = 0.001, HR = 3.24, 95{\%} CI: 2.03–8.08) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015, HR = 1.66, 95{\%} CI: 1.02–3.13) were significant predictors. Conclusions: Serum miR-124 levels have utility as diagnostic biomarkers in patients with PDAC. These findings suggest, for the first time, that serum miR-124 levels may have prognostic impact in patients with PDAC.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly fatal disease worldwide and is often misdiagnosed in its early stages. The exploration of novel non-invasive biomarkers will definitely benefit PC patients. Recently, circulating miRNAs in body fluids are emerging as non-invasive biomarkers for PC diagnosis. In this study, we first conducted comprehensive robust rank aggregation (RRA) analysis based on 21 published miRome profiling studies. We statistically identified and clinically validated a miRNA expression pattern in PC patients. These miRNAs consisted of four up-regulated (hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-210-3p and hsa-miR-155-5p) and three down-regulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-217, hsa-miR-148a-3p and hsa-miR-375). Among them, hsa-miR-21-5p was one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in the serum of PC patients. Our validation test further suggested a relatively high accuracy of serum hsa-miR-21-5p levels in the diagnosis of PC, with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.80. Finally, a diagnostic meta-analysis based on 9 studies also revealed favorable sensitivity and specificity of circulating hsa-miR-21-5p for the diagnosis of PC (pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 and 0.74, respectively), which was consistent with our findings. Taken together, as one of the most aberrantly expressed miRNAs in PC, circulating hsa-miR-21-5p might be a promising serum biomarker in patients with PC.},

Ongoing research continues to uncover novel pathways, including the important role of non-protein coding RNA transcripts in epigenetic gene regulation. We know that the majority of human and other mammalian transcripts are not translated but that many of these are nonetheless functional. These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be short ({\textless} 200 nt) or long ({\textless} 200 nt) and are further classified by genomic origin and mechanism of action.

abstract = {Although the inflammation-associated cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in cholangiocarcinoma growth, the relationship between IL-6 and oncogenic changes is unknown. IL-6 can increase expression of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT-1) and epigenetically regulate the expression of several genes, including microRNAs (miRNAs). DNMT-1 up-regulation occurs in hepatobiliary cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. To understand the potential regulation of DNMT-1 by IL-6-dependent miRNAs, we examined the expression of a group of miRNAs which have sequence complementarity to the 3'-untranslated region of DNMT-1, namely miR-148a, miR-152, and miR-301. The expression of these miRNAs was decreased in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Moreover, the expression of all three miRNAs was decreased in IL-6-overexpressing malignant cholangiocytes in vitro and in tumor cell xenografts. There was a concomitant decrease in expression of the methylationsensitive tumor suppressor genes Rassf1a and p16INK4a. Using luciferase reporter constructs, DNMT-1 was verified as a target for miR-148a and miR-152. Precursors to miR-148a and miR-152 decreased DNMT-1 protein expression, increased Rassf1a and p16INK4a expression, and reduced cell proliferation. Conclusion: These data indicate that IL-6 can regulate the activity of DNMT-1 and expression of methylation- dependent tumor suppressor genes by modulation of miR-148a and miR-152, and provide a link between this inflammation-associated cytokine and oncogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma.

This study was divided into three parts: (1) Confirmation of higher miR-18a levels in primary pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines than in normal pancreatic tissues and a human fibroblast cell line. (2) Evaluation of the plasma miR-18a assay using quantitative RT-PCR by comparing plasma results obtained from 36 patients with pancreatic cancer and from 30 healthy volunteers. (3) Evaluation of the assay for monitoring tumour dynamics in patients with pancreatic cancer. Results: (1) The expression of miR-18a was significantly higher in pancreatic cancer tissues (P{\textless}0.012) and pancreatic cancer cell lines (P{\textless}0.015) than in normal tissues and fibroblasts. (2) Plasma concentrations of miR-18a were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer patients than in controls (P{\textless}0.0001). The value of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.9369. (3) Plasma levels of miR-18a were significantly lower in postoperative samples than in preoperative samples (P{\textless}0.0077).Conclusion:Circulating miR-18a might provide new complementary tumour markers for pancreatic cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose: Our goal was to identify circulating micro RNA (miRNA) levels that could distinguish patients with low-stage pancreatic cancer from healthy and disease controls. Experimental Design: We measured 735 miRNAs in pancreatic cancer case and control sera by QRTPCR using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays. After array analysis, we selected 18 miRNA candidates for validation in an independent set of cases and control samples. Results: Of the significantly elevated circulating miRNAs in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls, miR-1290 had the best diagnostic performance: receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on miR-1290 serum level yielded curve areas (AUC) of 0.96 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.91-1.00], 0.81 (0.71-0.91), and 0.80 (0.67-0.93), for subjects with pancreatic cancer ( n = 41) relative to healthy controls (n = 19), subjects with chronic pancreatitis (n = 35), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( n = 18), respectively. Serum miR-1290 levels were also significantly higher than healthy controls among patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN; n = 20; AUC = 0.76, 0.61-0.91). Serum miR-1290 levels distinguished patients with low-stage pancreatic cancer from controls better than CA19-9 levels, and like CA19-9, higher miR-1290 levels predicted poorer outcome among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Greater numbers of miR-1290 transcripts were detected by FISH in primary pancreatic cancer and IPMN than normal pancreatic duct cells. miR-1290 influenced in vitro pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasive ability. Several other circulating miRNAs distinguished sera of patients with pancreatic cancer from those of healthy controls with AUCs {\textgreater}0.7, including miR-24, miR-134, miR-146a, miR-378, miR-484, miR-628-3p, and miR-1825. Conclusions: The detection of elevated circulating miR-1290 has the potential to improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer. {\textcopyright}2013 AACR.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs have potential as diagnostic cancer biomarkers. The aim of this study was (1) to define microRNA expression patterns in formalin-fixed parafin-embedded tissue from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, ampullary adenocarcinoma, normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis without using micro-dissection and (2) to discover new diagnostic microRNAs and combinations of microRNAs in cancer tissue. The expression of 664 microRNAs in tissue from 170 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 107 ampullary adenocarcinomas were analyzed using a commercial microRNA assay. Results were compared with chronic pancreatitis, normal pancreas and duodenal adenocarcinoma. In all, 43 microRNAs had higher and 41 microRNAs reduced expression in pancreatic cancer compared with normal pancreas. In all, 32 microRNAs were differently expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with chronic pancreatitis (17 higher; 15 reduced). Several of these microRNAs have not before been related to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (eg, miR-492, miR-614, miR-622). MiR-614, miR-492, miR-622, miR-135b and miR-196 were most differently expressed. MicroRNA profiles of pancreatic and ampullary adenocarcinomas were correlated (0.990). MicroRNA expression profiles for pancreatic cancer described in the literature were consistent with our findings, and the microRNA profile for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (miR-196b-miR-217) was validated. We identified a more significant expression profile, the difference between miR-411 and miR-198 (P2.06 × 10 54) and a diagnostic LASSO classifier using 19 microRNAs (sensitivity 98.5{\%}; positive predictive value 97.8{\%}; accuracy 97.0{\%}). We also identified microRNA profiles to subclassify ampullary adenocarcinomas into pancreatobiliary or intestinal type. In conclusion, we found that combinations of two microRNAs could roughly separate neoplastic from non-neoplastic samples. A diagnostic 19 microRNA classifier was constructed which without micro-dissection could discriminate pancreatic and ampullary adenocarcinomas from chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreas with high sensitivity and accuracy. Ongoing prospective studies will evaluate if these microRNA profiles are useful on fine-needle biopsies for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 USCAP, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Glypican-1 (GPC1) is expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and adjacent stromal fibroblasts. Recently, GPC1 circulating exosomes (crExos) have been shown to be able to detect early stages of PDAC. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of crExos GPC1 as a biomarker for PDAC. Methods: Plasma was obtained from patients with benign pancreatic disease (n = 16) and PDAC (n = 27) prior to pancreatectomy, and crExos were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. Protein was extracted from surgical specimens (adjacent normal pancreas, n = 13; and PDAC, n = 17). GPC1 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: There was no significant difference in GPC1 levels between normal pancreas and PDAC tissues. This was also true when comparing matched pairs. However, GPC1 levels were enriched in PDAC crExos (n = 11), compared to the source tumors (n = 11; 97 ± 54 vs. 20.9 ± 12.3 pg/mL; P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, PDACs with high GPC1 expression tended to have crExos with higher GPC1 levels. Despite these findings, we were unable to distinguish PDAC from benign pancreatic disease using crExos GPC1 levels. Interestingly, we found that in matched pre and post-operative plasma samples there was a significant drop in crExos GPC1 levels after surgical resection for PDAC (n = 11 vs. 11; 97 ± 54 vs. 77.8 ± 32.4 pg/mL; P = 0.0428). Furthermore, we found that patients with high crExos GPC1 levels have significantly larger PDACs ( {\textgreater} 4 cm; P = 0.012). Conclusions: High GPC1 crExos may be able to determine PDAC tumor size and disease burden. However, further efforts are needed to elucidate its role as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker using larger cohorts of PDAC patients.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, a biomarker for a sensitive and simple diagnostic test and highly effective target therapy of CRC is still clinically unavailable. This study is to investigate the evidence and significance of plasma GPC1 positive exosomes as a biomarker of CRC. Results showed that GPC1+ exosomes were successfully isolated from tissues and plasma. The percentage of GPC1+ exosomes and the GPC1 protein expression in exosomes from tumour tissues and plasma of CRC patients before surgical treatment was significantly elevated compared to that in the peritumoural tissues and the plasma of healthy controls. miR-96-5p and miR-149 expression in tumour tissues and plasma of CRC patients as well as in the GPC1+ exosomes from CRC patients were significantly decreased compared to that in the peritumoural tissues and the plasma of healthy controls. Two months after surgical treatment, levels of all tested markers significantly normalized. Overexpression of miR-96-5p and miR-149 significantly decreased GPC1 expression in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells, xenograft tumours, plasma in mice bearing HT-29 and HCT-116 tumours, and the secretion of GPC1+ exosomes from the HT-29 and HCT-116 cells and xenograft tumours. Overexpression of miR-96-5p and miR-149 significantly decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells, and inhibited the growth of xenograft HT-29 and HCT-116 tumours. In conclusion, the increased plasma GPC1+ exosomes and reduced plasma miR-96-5p and miR-149 expression are specific markers for the diagnosis of CRC and targets for the therapy of CRC.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy that often presents clinically at an advanced stage and that may be confused with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Conversely, CP may be misdiagnosed as PDAC leading to unwarranted pancreas resection. Therefore, early PDAC diagnosis and clear differentiation between PDAC and CP are crucial for improved care. Exosomes are circulating microvesicles whose components can serve as cancer biomarkers. We compared exosomal glypican-1 (GPC1) and microRNA levels in normal control subjects and in patients with PDAC and CP. We report that exosomal GPC1 is not diagnostic for PDAC, whereas high exosomal levels of microRNA-10b, (miR-10b), miR-21, miR-30c, and miR-181a and low miR-let7a readily differentiate PDAC from normal control and CP samples. By contrast with GPC1, elevated exosomal miR levels decreased to normal values within 24 h following PDAC resection. All 29 PDAC cases exhibited significantly elevated exosomal miR-10b and miR-30c levels, whereas 8 cases had normal or slightly increased CA 19-9 levels. Thus, our exosomal miR signature is superior to exosomal GPC1 or plasma CA 19-9 levels in establishing a diagnosis of PDAC and differentiating between PDAC and CP.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease for a multitude of reasons including very late diagnosis. This in part is due to the lack of understanding of the biological behavior of PDAC and the ineffective screening for this disease. Significant efforts have been dedicated to finding the appropriate serum and imaging biomarkers to help early detection and predict response to treatment of PDAC. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) has been the most validated serum marker and has the highest positive predictive value as a stand-alone marker. When combined with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125), CA 19-9 can help predict the outcome of patients to surgery and chemotherapy. A slew of novel serum markers including multimarker panels as well as genetic and epigenetic materials have potential for early detection of pancreatic cancer, although these remain to be validated in larger trials. Imaging studies may not correlate with elevated serum markers. Critical features for determining PDAC include the presence of a mass, dilated pancreatic duct, and a duct cut-off sign. Features that are indicative of early metastasis includes neurovascular bundle involvement, duodenal invasion, and greater post contrast enhancement. 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) radiotracer uptake and changes following treatment may predict patient overall survival following treatment. Similarly, pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may predict prognosis with lower ADC lesions having worse outcome. Although these markers have provided significant improvement in the care of pancreatic cancer patients, further advancements can be made with perhaps better combination of markers or discovery of unique marker(s) to pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the application value of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125 and CA242 in diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer cases treated with concurrent chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: 52 patients with pancreatic cancer, 40 with benign pancreatic diseases and 40 healthy people were selected. The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method was used for detecting levels of CA19-9, CEA and CA125, and a CanAg CA242 enzyme linked immunoassay kit for assessing the level of CA242. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for analyzing the prognostic factors of patients with pancreatic cancer. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for analyzing the hazard ratio (HR) and 95{\%} confidential interval (CI) for survival time of patients with pancreatic cancer. Results: The levels of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125 and CA242 in patients with pancreatic cancer were significantly higher than those in patients with benign pancreatic diseases and healthy people (P {\textless} 0.001). The sensitivity of CA19-9 was the highest among these, followed by CA242, CA125 and CEA. The specificity of CA242 is the highest, followed by CA125, CEA and CA19-9. The sensitivity and specificity of joint detection of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125and CA242 were 90.4{\%} and 93.8{\%}, obviously higher than single detection of those markers in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The median survival time of 52 patients with pancreatic cancer was 10 months (95{\%} CI7.389{\~{}}12.611).. Patients with the increasing level of serum CA19-9, CEA, CA125, CA242 had shorter survival times (P=0.047. 0.043, 0.0041, 0.029). COX regression analysis showed that CA19-9 was an independent prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer (P=0.001, 95{\%}CI 2.591{\~{}}38.243). Conclusions: The detection of serum tumor markers (CA19.9, CEA, CA125 and CA242) is conducive to the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and joint detection of tumor markers helps improve the diagnostic efficiency. Moreover, CA19-9 is an independent prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Background: The clinical management of pancreatic cancer is severely hampered by the absence of effective screening tools. Methods: Sixty-seven biomarkers were evaluated in prediagnostic sera obtained from cases of pancreatic cancer enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Results: The panel of CA 19-9, OPN, and OPG, identified in a prior retrospective study, was not effective. CA 19-9, CEA, NSE, bHCG, CEACAM1 and PRL were significantly altered in sera obtained from cases greater than 1 year prior to diagnosis. Levels of CA 19-9, CA 125, CEA, PRL, and IL-8 were negatively associated with time to diagnosis. A training/validation study using alternate halves of the PLCO set failed to identify a biomarker panel with significantly improved performance over CA 19-9 alone. When the entire PLCO set was used for training at a specificity (SP) of 95{\%}, a panel of CA 19-9, CEA, and Cyfra 21-1 provided significantly elevated sensitivity (SN) levels of 32.4{\%} and 29.7{\%} in samples collected {\textless}1 and {\textgreater}1 year prior to diagnosis, respectively, compared to SN levels of 25.7{\%} and 17.2{\%} for CA 19-9 alone. Conclusions: Most biomarkers identified in previously conducted case/control studies are ineffective in prediagnostic samples, however several biomarkers were identified as significantly altered up to 35 months prior to diagnosis. Two newly derived biomarker combinations offered advantage over CA 19-9 alone in terms of SN, particularly in samples collected {\textgreater}1 year prior to diagnosis. However, the efficacy of biomarker-based tools remains limited at present. Several biomarkers demonstrated significant velocity related to time to diagnosis, an observation which may offer considerable potential for enhancements in early detection. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nolen et al.},

The optimal biomarker panel for diagnosis was computed using a combination of the PAM algorithm and logistic regression modeling. Biomarkers that were significantly prognostic for survival in combination were determined using univariate and multivariate Cox survival models. Results: Three markers, CA19-9, OPN and CHI3L1, measured in multiplex were found to have superior sensitivity for pancreatic cancer vs. CA19-9 alone (93{\%} vs. 80{\%}). In addition, we identified two markers, CEA and CA125, that when measured simultaneously have prognostic significance for survival for this clinical stage of pancreatic cancer (p {\textless} 0.003). Conclusions: A multiplex panel assaying CA19-9, OPN and CHI3L1 in plasma improves accuracy of pancreatic cancer diagnosis. A panel assaying CEA and CA125 in plasma can predict survival for this clinical cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. {\textcopyright} 2009 Chang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: Serum-biomarker based screening for pancreatic cancer could greatly improve survival in appropriately targeted high-risk populations. Experimental Design: Eighty-three circulating proteins were analyzed in sera of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n = 333), benign pancreatic conditions (n = 144), and healthy control individuals (n = 227). Samples from each group were split randomly into training and blinded validation sets prior to analysis. A Metropolis algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation (MMC) was used to identify discriminatory biomarker panels in the training set. Identified panels were evaluated in the validation set and in patients diagnosed with colon (n = 33), lung (n = 62), and breast (n = 108) cancers. Results: Several robust profiles of protein alterations were present in sera of PDAC patients compared to the Healthy and Benign groups. In the training set (n=160 PDAC, 74 Benign, 107 Healthy), the panel of CA 19-9, ICAM-1, and OPG discriminated PDAC patients from Healthy controls with a sensitivity/specificity (SN/SP) of 88/90{\%}, while the panel of CA 19-9, CEA, and TIMP-1 discriminated PDAC patients from Benign subjects with an SN/SP of 76/90{\%}. In an independent validation set (n=173 PDAC, 70 Benign, 120 Healthy), the panel of CA 19-9, ICAM-1 and OPG demonstrated an SN/SP of 78/94{\%} while the panel of CA19-9, CEA, and TIMP-1 demonstrated an SN/SP of 71/89{\%}. The CA19-9, ICAM-1, OPGpanel is selective for PDAC and does not recognize breast (SP = 100{\%}), lung (SP = 97{\%}), or colon (SP = 97{\%}) cancer. Conclusions: The PDAC-specific biomarker panels identified in this investigation warrant additional clinical validation to determine their role in screening targeted high-risk populations. {\textcopyright}2010 AACR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in serum has been considered to be a useful candidate for noninvasive cancer diagnosis. The current study was designed to estimate the clinical usefulness of genetic analysis for ctDNA by digital polymerase chain reaction in patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS The authors compared K-ras mutations detected in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy tissue DNA and in ctDNA from 75 patients with pancreatic cancer. K-ras mutations in the serum of 66 independent, consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer were also analyzed and the authors compared the results with survival rates. RESULTS The frequencies of the mutations in tissue samples at G12V, G12D, and G12R in codon 12 were 28 of 75 samples (37.3{\%}), 22 of 75 samples (29.3{\%}), and 6 of 75 samples (8.0{\%}), respectively. Conversely, the rates of the mutations in ctDNA were 26 of 75 samples (34.6{\%}), 29 of 75 samples (38.6{\%}), and 4 of 75 samples (5.3{\%}), respectively. Overall, the K-ras mutation rates in tissue and ctDNA were 74.7{\%} and 62.6{\%}, respectively, and the concordance rate between them was 58 of 75 samples (77.3{\%}). Survival did not appear to differ by the presence of K-ras mutations in tissue DNA, but the survival of patients with K-ras mutations in ctDNA was significantly shorter than that of patients without mutations in both a development set (P = .006) and an independent validation set (P = .002). The difference was especially evident in cases with a G12V mutation. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of ctDNA is a new useful procedure for detecting mutations in patients with pancreatic cancer. This noninvasive method may have great potential as a new strategy for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer as well as for predicting survival. Cancer 2015;121:2271-2280.},

Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a low level of plasma miR-223 was an independent risk factor for PIDC (p = 0.0012, odds ratio 7.90 [95{\%} CI: 2.06-41.2]). v) There was no significant correlation between plasma miR-223 levels and the number of any blood cell types in the peripheral blood.Conclusion: Plasma miR-223 might be a clinically useful biomarker for screening PCa, and predicting malignant potential of IPMN and the invasiveness of PCa.},

abstract = {Background: To improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer, new biomarkers are required for earlier, pre-symptomatic diagnosis. Epigenetic mutations take place at the earliest stages of tumorigenesis and therefore offer new approaches for detecting and diagnosing disease. Nucleosomes are the repeating subunits of DNA and histone proteins that constitute human chromatin. Because of their release into the circulation, intact nucleosome levels in serum or plasma can serve as diagnostic disease biomarkers, and elevated levels have been reported in various cancers. However, quantifying nucleosomes in the circulation for cancer detection has been challenging due to nonspecific elevation in sera of patients with benign diseases. Here, we report for the first time differential, disease-associated epigenetic profiles of intact cell-free nucleosomes (cfnucleosomes) containing specific DNA and histone modifications as well as histone variants circulating in the blood. The study comprised serum samples from 59 individuals, including 25 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, 10 patients with benign pancreatic disease, and 24 healthy individuals using Nucleosomics{\textregistered}, a novel ELISA method. Results: Multivariate analysis defined a panel of five serum cfnucleosome biomarkers that gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 for the discrimination of pancreatic cancer from healthy controls, which was superior to the diagnostic performance of the common pancreatic tumor biomarker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) with an AUC of 0.87. Combining CA 19-9 with a panel of four cfnucleosome biomarkers gave an AUC of 0.98 with an overall sensitivity of 92 {\%} at 90 {\%} specificity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that global epigenetic profiling of cfnucleosomes in serum using a simple NuQ{\textregistered} immunoassay-based approach can provide novel diagnostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Pancreatic tumors are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage in the progression of the disease, thus reducing the survival chances of the patients. Non-invasive early detection would greatly enhance therapy and survival rates. Toward this aim, we investigated in a pilot study the power of methylation changes in whole blood as predictive markers for the detection of pancreatic tumors. We investigated methylation levels at selected CpG sites in the CpG rich regions at the promoter regions of p16, RARbeta, TNFRSF10C, APC, ACIN1, DAPK1, 3OST2, BCL2 and CD44 in the blood of 30 pancreatic tumor patients and in the blood of 49 matching controls. In addition, we studied LINE-1 and Alu repeats using degenerate amplification approach as a surrogate marker for genome-wide methylation. The site-specific methylation measurements at selected CpG sites were done by the SIRPH method. Our results show that in the patient's blood, tumor suppressor genes were slightly but significantly higher methylated at several CpG sites, while repeats were slightly less methylated compared to control blood. This was found to be significantly associated with higher risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Additionally, high methylation levels at TNFRSCF10C were associated with positive perineural spread of tumor cells, while higher methylation levels of TNFRSF10C and ACIN1 were significantly associated with shorter survival. This pilot study shows that methylation changes in blood could provide a promising method for early detection of pancreatic tumors. However, larger studies must be carried out to explore the clinical usefulness of a whole blood methylation based test for non-invasive early detection of pancreatic tumors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Dauksa et al.},

abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) is one of most difficult tumors to treat. Much of this is attributed to the late diagnosis. To identify biomarkers for early detection, we examined DNA methylation differences in leukocyte DNA between PaC cases and controls in a two-phase study. In phase I, we measured methylation levels at 1,505 CpG sites in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve leukocyte DNA from 132 never-smoker PaC patients and 60 never-smoker healthy controls. We found significant differences in 110 CpG sites (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05). In phase II, we tested and validated 88 of 96 phase I selected CpG sites in 240 PaC cases and 240 matched controls (p≤0.05). Using penalized logistic regression, we built a prediction model consisting of five CpG sites (IL10{\_}P348, LCN2{\_}P86, ZAP70{\_}P220, AIM2{\_}P624, TAL1{\_}P817) that discriminated PaC patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.85 in phase I; 0.76 in phase II). Interestingly, one CpG site (LCN2{\_}P86) alone could discriminate resectable patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.78 in phase I; 0.74 in phase II). We also performed methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis and identified three CpG sites (AGXT{\_}P180{\_}F, ALOX12{\_}E85{\_}R, JAK3{\_}P1075{\_}R) where the methylation levels were significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05). Our results demonstrate that epigenetic variation in easily obtainable leukocyte DNA, manifested by reproducible methylation differences, may be used to detect PaC patients. The methylation differences at certain CpG sites are partially attributable to genetic variation. This study strongly supports future epigenome-wide association study using leukocyte DNA for biomarker discovery in human diseases. {\textcopyright} 2011 Pedersen et al.},

abstract = {Background and Aim: Although the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is generally poor, it is well known that the survival rate for resected pancreatic cancer is much higher than that for more conservative treatment. The importance of early detection is emphasized for resection of pancreatic cancer. Measurement of serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 has shown satisfactory sensitivity and predictive value in symptomatic patients, but no available data has been found on healthy asymptomatic subjects. Thus, the authors aimed to determine the clinical usefulness of CA 19-9 as a screening tool for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic subjects. Methods: From December 1994 to November 2000, 70 940 asymptomatic persons visiting the Health Promotion Center at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, participated. All subjects underwent abdominal ultrasonography and serum CA 19-9 measurement. The authors analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of CA 19-9 for detecting pancreatic cancer. Also, those subjects who had a serum CA 19-9 level above the cut-off value were followed up using a serial check of CA 19-9, computed tomography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Results: The number of subjects with a level of CA 19-9 above the cutoff of 37 U/mL was 1063 (1.5{\%}), including four cases diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The prevalence of pancreatic cancer over the age of 30 years is 13.66 per 100 000 population in Korea. Therefore, the sensitivity is 100{\%} and the specificity 98.5{\%}. However, the positive predictive value of CA 19-9 for detecting pancreatic cancer is only 0.9{\%} in the asymptomatic population. Conclusion: Mass screening for pancreatic cancer using CA 19-9 levels in asymptomatic subjects is ineffective because of a very low positive predictive value, despite its high sensitivity and specificity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

We hypothesized that any CA 19-9 elevation indicates biologically borderline resectability. Study Design The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB 2010 to 2012) was reviewed for PDAC patients with reported CA 19-9. Nonsecretors were analyzed separately. Early stage (I/II) patients were stratified by CA 19-9 above or below normal (37 U/mL). Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox proportional hazards survival modeling were performed. Results Of 113,145 patients, only 28,074 (24.8{\%}) had CA 19-9 measured and reported, and this proportion was stage independent. Among early stage patients (n = 10,806), there were 957 (8.8{\%}) nonsecretors, 2,708 (25.1{\%}) with normal levels, and 7,141 (66.1{\%}) with elevated levels. Demographics and perioperative outcomes were similar between these groups. Survival was worse in all stages in patients with CA 19-9 elevation. Nonsecretors had survival similar to that of patients with normal levels. Early stage patients with elevated CA 19-9 had decreased survival at 1, 2, and 3 years (56{\%} vs 68{\%}, 30{\%} vs 42{\%}, 15{\%} vs 25{\%}, all p {\textless} 0.001) relative to patients with normal levels. Adjusted modeling confirmed this finding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, p {\textless} 0.001). Repeat modeling in the neoadjuvant cohort demonstrated this to be the only treatment sequence to completely abrogate increased mortality due to CA 19-9 elevation (p = 0.11). Conclusions The minority of PDAC patients have CA 19-9 measured and reported in NCDB. The CA 19-9 nonsecretors and normal-level patients achieve equivalent survival. Elevation of CA 19-9 is associated with decreased stage-specific survival, with the greatest difference in early stages. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy followed by curative intent surgery best mitigates the increased mortality hazard. Patients with PDAC who have elevated CA 19-9 levels at diagnosis are biologically borderline resectable regardless of anatomic resectability, and neoadjuvant systemic therapy is suggested.},

abstract = {Background: Serum carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9) is the most common tumor marker assessed in pancreatic cancer patients; nevertheless few articles have comprehensively evaluated the evidence for its utility in pancreatic cancer management. Methods: Literature search was performed using Medline with keywords "pancreatic cancer" "tumor markers" "CA 19-9" "diagnosis" "screening" "prognosis" "resectability" and "recurrence". All English language articles pertaining to the role of CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer were critically analyzed to determine its utility as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Results: Serum CA 19-9 is the most extensively validated pancreatic cancer biomarker with multiple clinical applications. CA 19-9 serum levels have a sensitivity and specificity of 79-81{\%} and 82-90{\%} respectively for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients; but are not useful as a screening marker because of low positive predictive value (0.5-0.9{\%}). Pre-operative CA 19-9 serum levels provide useful prognostic information as patients with normal levels ({\textless}37 U/mL) have a prolonged median survival (32-36 months) compared to patients with elevated levels ({\textgreater}37 U/mL) (12-15 months). A CA 19-9 serum level of {\textless}100 U/mL implies likely resectable disease whereas levels {\textgreater}100 U/mL suggest unresectablity or metastatic disease. Normalization or a decrease in post-operative CA 19-9 serum levels by ≥20-50{\%} from baseline following surgical resection or chemotherapy is associated with prolonged survival compared to failure of CA 19-9 serum levels to normalize or an increase. Important limitations to CA 19-9 serum level evaluation in pancreatic cancer include poor sensitivity, false negative results in Lewis negative phenotype (5-10{\%}) and increased false positivity in the presence of obstructive jaundice (10-60{\%}). Conclusions: CA 19-9 is the most extensively studied and validated serum biomarker for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients. CA 19-9 serum levels can provide important information with regards to prognosis, overall survival, and response to chemotherapy as well as predict post-operative recurrence. However, non-specific expression in several benign and malignant diseases, false negative results in Lewis negative genotype and an increased false positive results in the presence of obstructive jaundice severely limit the universal applicability of serum CA 19-9 levels in pancreatic cancer management. {\textcopyright} Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.},

abstract = {CA 19-9 and CEA are the most commonly used biomarkers for diagnosis and management of patients with pancreatic cancer. Since the original compendium by Steinberg in 1990, numerous studies have reported the use of CA 19-9 and, to a lesser extent, CEA in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Here we update an evaluation of the accuracy of CA 19-9 and CEA, and, unlike previous reviews, focus on discrimination between malignant and benign disease instead of normal controls. In 57 studies involving 3,285 pancreatic carcinoma cases, the combined sensitivity of CA 19-9 was 78.2{\%} and in 37 studies involving 1,882 cases with benign pancreatic disease the specificity of CA 19-9 was 82.8{\%}. From the combined analysis of studies reporting CEA, the sensitivity was 44.2{\%} (1,324 cases) and the specificity was 84.8{\%} (656 cases). These measurements more appropriately reflect the expected biomarker accuracy in the differential diagnosis of patients with periampullary diseases. We also present a summary of the use of CA 19-9 as a prognostic tool and evaluate CA 19-9 diagnostic and prognostic utility in a 10-year, single institution experience.},

abstract = {Background: Although the outcomes of pancreatic cancer have been improved by gemcitabine, the changes in its characteristics and long-term outcomes within the gemcitabine era remain unclear. This study was conducted to identify clinical characteristics of pancreatic cancer patients within the gemcitabine era.Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed at 10 centers for 1,248 consecutive patients who were ever considered to have a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer between 2001 and 2010. Data collected included demographics, diagnosis date, clinical stage, treatment, and outcome; 1,082 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed further. The chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression. Differences in survival analyses were determined using the log-rank test.Results: The distribution of clinical stages was: I, 2.2{\%}; II, 3.4{\%}; III, 13{\%}; IVa, 27{\%}; and IVb, 55{\%}. Chemotherapy alone was administered to 42{\%} of patients and 17{\%} underwent resection. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 39{\%}, 13{\%}, and 6.9{\%}, respectively. The median survival time was 257 days, but differed considerably among treatments and clinical stages. Demographics, distribution of clinical stage, and cause of death did not differ between groups A (2001-2005, n = 406) and B (2006-2010, n = 676). However, group B included more patients who underwent chemotherapy (P {\textless} 0.0001) and fewer treated with best supportive care (P = 0.0004), mirroring improvements in this group's long-term outcomes (P = 0.0063). Finally, factors associated with long-term outcomes derived from multivariate analysis were clinical stage (P {\textless} 0.0001), location of the tumor (P = 0.0294) and treatments (surgery, chemotherapy) (P {\textless} 0.0001).Conclusions: Long-term outcomes in pancreatic cancer has improved even within the gemcitabine era, suggesting the importance of offering chemotherapy to patients previously only considered for best supportive care. Most patients are still diagnosed at an advanced stage, making clinical strategy development for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages essential. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kuroda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

A total of 167 PC patients with the corresponding clinical data were enrolled in our study. The miRNAs significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in PC patients were identified with Cox proportional regression model. A risk score formula was developed to evaluate the prognostic value of the miRNA signature in PC. Thirteen miRNAs were identified to be significantly related with OS in PC patients. Patients with high risk score suffered poor overall survival compared with patients who had low risk score. The multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the miRNA signature could act as an independent prognostic indicator. In addition, the signature might serve as a predicator for treatment outcome. Our study identified a miRNA signature including 13 miRNAs which could serve as an independent marker in prognosis of PC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to identify the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression mediated by miRNAs and DNA methylation in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS:   The miRNAs and mRNAs expression and DNA methylation data of COAD and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, miRNA-mRNA pairs were obtained by correlation analysis and prediction algorithms. Finally, COAD-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was generated. Additionally, the biological functions of miRNA targets were further revealed by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Besides, the correlation analysis between gene expression and DNA methylation was also performed after differential analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 55 differentially expressed miRNAs and 1291 differentially expressed mRNAs in COAD compared with adjacent normal tissues. We observed a global miRNA up-regulation in tumors. A total of 58 miRNA-mRNA pairs were not only predicted by algorithms but also negatively correlated. The increased expression of has-mir-141, -19a, -20a 19b-1, 19b-2, 16, 590 and -335 were closely associated with the carcinogenesis of COAD. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the miRNA targets were significantly enriched in pancreatic secretion, salivary secretion, gastric acid secretion and bile secretion. Regarding the regulatory role of DNA methylation, we identified 11 genes whose expressions were negatively correlated with DNA methylation level. Among those genes, MSX1 and KRT7 were down-regulated and hypermethylated in COAD compared with adjacent normal tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: These eight miRNAs (has-mir-141, -19a, -20a 19b-1, 19b-2, 16, 590 and -335) and two genes (MSX1 and KRT7) may play a role in the process of COAD. These findings highlighted the potential regulatory mechanisms of miRNA and DNA methylation on mRNA expression in COAD carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is highly associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the mechanisms are insufficient. The study aimed to uncover the underlying regulatory mechanism on diabetic PaC and find novel biomarkers for the disease prognosis. Two RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, GSE74629 and GSE15932, as well as relevant data in TCGA were utilized. After pretreatment, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or miRNAs (DEMs) or lncRNAs (DELs) between diabetic PaC and non-diabetic PaC patients were identified, and further examined for their correlations with clinical information. Prognostic RNAs were selected using KM curve. Optimal gene set for classification of different samples were recognized by support vector machine. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for DEGs based on protein databases. Interactions among three kinds of RNAs were revealed in the ‘lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA' competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. A group of 32 feature genes were identified that could classify diabetic PaC from non-diabetic PaC, such as CCDC33, CTLA4 and MAP4K1. This classifier had a high accuracy on the prediction. Seven lncRNAs were tied up with prognosis of diabetic PaC, especially UCA1. In addition, crucial DEMs were selected, such as hsa-miR-214 (predicted targets: MAP4K1 and CCDC33) and hsa-miR-429 (predicted targets: CTLA4). Notably, interactions of ‘HOTAIR-hsa-miR-214-CCDC33' and ‘CECR7-hsa-miR-429-CTLA4' were highlighted in the ceRNA network. Several biomarkers were identified for diagnosis of diabetic PaC, such as HOTAIR, CECR7, UCA1, hsa-miR-214, hsa-miR-429, CCDC33 and CTLA4. ‘HOTAIR-hsa-miR-214-CCDC33' and ‘CECR7-hsa-miR-429-CTLA4' regulations might be two important mechanisms for the disease progression.},

abstract = {Background: It has been reported that miR-203 expression was aberrant in various types of cancers, and it could be used as a prognostic biomarker. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-203 expression in solid tumors by using meta-analysis and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Methods: By doing a literature research in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library (last update by December 2016), we were able to identify the studies assessing the prognostic role of miR-203 in various tumors. We then used TCGA datasets to validate the results of meta-analysis. Results:33 studies from 26 articles were qualified and enrolled in this meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed that higher expression of miR-203 in tissues couldn't predict poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in solid tumors. However, the results of subgroup analyses revealed that the upregulation of tissue miR-203 expression was associated with poor OS in colorectal cancer (hazard ratio (HR)=1.81, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) 1.31-2.49; P{\textless}0.001), pancreatic cancer (HR=1.19, 95{\%} CI 1.09-1.31; P{\textless}0.001) and ovarian cancer (HR=1.85, 95{\%} CI 1.45-2.37; P{\textless}0.001); but it had opposite association in liver cancer (HR=0.52, 95{\%} CI 0.28-0.97; P=0.040) and esophageal cancer (HR=0.41, 95{\%} CI 0.25-0.66; P{\textless}0.001). Based on TCGA datasets, we found the same results for pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer, but not for colorectal cancer and liver cancer. Moreover, patients with high circulating miR-203 in blood had significantly poor OS and PFS in colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Conclusion: Our study showed that the prognostic values of tissue miR-203 varied in different tumor types. In addition, the upregulation of circulating miR-203 in blood was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and breast cancer.},

abstract = {Although certain biomarkers that are directly associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) have been identified, the efficacy of a single factor is limited to predicting the prognosis. The aim of the present study was to identify a combination micro (mi)RNA signature that enhanced the prognostic prediction for PAAD. Following analysis of the data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 175 PAAD samples were selected for the present study, and the associations between 494 miRNAs and OS were investigated. The prognostic value of all miRNAs was analyzed by multivariate Cox regression, and the miRNAs were ranked according to the hazard ratio (HR) and P-values. The top 5 miRNAs (miR-1301, miR-125a, miR-376c, miR-328 and miR-376b) were significantly associated with OS (HR=0.139; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.043-0.443; P{\textless}0.001), thus demonstrating that this panel was able to serve as an independent prognostic factor for PAAD. In addition, the present study also predicted the target genes of the top 10 miRNAs with the highest prognostic values using 12 different prediction software, and enrichment signaling pathway analyses elucidated that several pathways may be markedly associated with these miRNAs, including 'Pathways in cancer', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Glioma' and 'MicroRNAs in cancer'. Lastly, ubiquitin C, epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 and androgen receptor may be the hub genes revealed by STRING analysis. The present study identified several miRNAs, particularly a five-miRNA-pool, that may be reliable, independent factors for predicting survival in patients with PAAD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms require further investigation in the future.},

abstract = {Late diagnosis and systemic dissemination essentially contribute to the invariably poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Therefore, the development of diagnostic biomarkers for PDAC are urgently needed to improve patient stratification and outcome in the clinic. By studying the transcriptomes of independent PDAC patient cohorts of tumor and non-tumor tissues, we identified 81 robustly regulated genes, through a novel, generally applicable meta-analysis. Using consensus clustering on co-expression values revealed four distinct clusters with genes originating from exocrine/endocrine pancreas, stromal and tumor cells. Three clusters were strongly associated with survival of PDAC patients based on TCGA database underlining the prognostic potential of the identified genes. With the added information of impact of survival and the robustness within the meta-analysis, we extracted a 17-gene subset for further validation. We show that it did not only discriminate PDAC from non-tumor tissue and stroma in fresh-frozen as well as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples, but also detected pancreatic precursor lesions and singled out pancreatitis samples. Moreover, the classifier discriminated PDAC from other cancers in the TCGA database. In addition, we experimentally validated the classifier in PDAC patients on transcript level using qPCR and exemplify the usage on protein level for three proteins (AHNAK2, LAMC2, TFF1) using immunohistochemistry and for two secreted proteins (TFF1, SERPINB5) using ELISA-based protein detection in blood-plasma. In conclusion, we present a novel robust diagnostic and prognostic gene signature for PDAC with future potential applicability in the clinic.},

The activity of a miRNA in a biological process can often be reflected in the expression program that characterizes the outcome of the activity. We introduce a computational approach that infers such activity from high-throughput data using a novel statistical methodology, called minimum-mHG (mmHG), that examines mutual enrichment in two ranked lists. Based on this methodology, we provide a user-friendly web application that supports the statistical assessment of miRNA target enrichment analysis (miTEA) in the top of a ranked list of genes or proteins. Using miTEA, we analyze several target prediction tools by examining performance on public miRNA constitutive expression data. We also apply miTEA to analyze several integrative biology data sets, including a novel matched miRNA/mRNA data set covering nine human tissue types. Our novel findings include proposed direct activity of miR-519 in placenta, a direct activity of the oncogenic miR-15 in different healthy tissue types and a direct activity of the poorly characterized miR-768 in both healthy tissue types and cancer cell lines. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) 2012.

However, the negative binomial distribution (NB) and high dimensionality of data obtained using sequencing can lead to low-power results and low reproducibility. Several statistical learning algorithms have been proposed to address sequencing data, and although evaluation of these methods is essential, such studies are relatively rare. The performance of seven feature selection (FS) algorithms, including baySeq, DESeq, edgeR, the rank sum test, lasso, particle swarm optimistic decision tree, and random forest (RF), was compared by simulation under different conditions based on the difference of the mean, the dispersion parameter of the NB, and the signal to noise ratio. Real data were used to evaluate the performance of RF, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Based on the simulation and real data, we discuss the behaviour of the FS and classification algorithms. The Apriori algorithm identified frequent item sets (mir-133a, mir-133b, mir-183, mir-937, and mir-96) from among the deregulated miRNAs of six datasets from The Cancer Genomics Atlas. Taking these findings altogether and considering computational memory requirements, we propose a strategy that combines edgeR and DESeq for large sample sizes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new feature selection method that uses a backward elimination procedure similar to that implemented in support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Unlike the SVM-RFE method, at each step, the proposed approach computes the feature ranking score from a statistical analysis of weight vectors of multiple linear SVMs trained on subsamples of the original training data. We tested the proposed method on four gene expression datasets for cancer classification. The results show that the proposed feature selection method selects better gene subsets than the original SVM-RFE and improves the classification accuracy. A Gene Ontology-based similarity assessment indicates that the selected subsets are functionally diverse, further validating our gene selection method. This investigation also suggests that, for gene expression-based cancer classification, average test error from multiple partitions of training and test sets can be recommended as a reference of performance quality. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Accurate normalization is an absolute prerequisite for correct measurement of gene expression. For quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the most commonly used normalization strategy involves standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene. However, in recent years, it has become clear that no single gene is constitutively expressed in all cell types and under all experimental conditions, implying that the expression stability of the intended control gene has to be verified before each experiment. We outline a novel, innovative, and robust strategy to identify stably expressed genes among a set of candidate normalization genes. The strategy is rooted in a mathematical model of gene expression that enables estimation not only of the overall variation of the candidate normalization genes but also of the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set. Notably, the strategy provides a direct measure for the estimated expression variation, enabling the user to evaluate the systematic error introduced when using the gene. In a side-by-side comparison with a previously published strategy, our model-based approach performed in a more robust manner and showed less sensitivity toward coregulation of the candidate normalization genes. We used the model-based strategy to identify genes suited to normalize quantitative RT-PCR data from colon cancer and bladder cancer. These genes are UBC, GAPD, and TPT1 for the colon and HSPCB, TEGT, and ATP5B for the bladder. The presented strategy can be applied to evaluate the suitability of any normalization gene candidate in any kind of experimental design and should allow more reliable normalization of RT-PCR data.},

We measured an identical set of 20 standardized positive and negative control samples, including human universal reference rnA, human brain rnA and titrations thereof, human serum samples and synthetic spikes from micrornA family members with varying homology. We developed robust quality metrics to objectively assess platform performance in terms of reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, specifcity and concordance of differential expression. the results indicate that each method has its strengths and weaknesses, which help to guide informed selection of a quantitative micrornA gene expression platform for particular study goals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.

Nonetheless, so far, results from the two technologies have only been compared based on biological data, leading to the conclusion that, although they are somewhat correlated, expression values differ significantly. Here, we use synthetic RNA samples, resembling human microRNA samples, to find that microarray expression measures actually correlate better with sample RNA content than expression measures obtained from sequencing data. In addition, microarrays appear highly sensitive and perform equivalently to next-generation sequencing in terms of reproducibility and relative ratio quantification.

abstract = {Background: microRNAs (miRNA) are short, endogenous transcripts that negatively regulate the expression of specific mRNA targets. miRNAs are found both in tissues and body fluids such as plasma. A major perspective for the use of miRNAs in the clinical setting is as diagnostic plasma markers for neoplasia. While miRNAs are abundant in tissues, they are often scarce in plasma. For quantification of miRNA in plasma it is therefore of importance to use a platform with high sensitivity and linear performance in the low concentration range. This motivated us to evaluate the performance of three commonly used commercial miRNA quantification platforms: GeneChip miRNA 2.0 Array, miRCURY Ready-to-Use PCR, Human panel I+II V1.M, and TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array v3.0.Results: Using synthetic miRNA samples and plasma RNA samples spiked with different ratios of 174 synthetic miRNAs we assessed the performance characteristics reproducibility, recovery, specificity, sensitivity and linearity. It was found that while the qRT-PCR based platforms were sufficiently sensitive to reproducibly detect miRNAs at the abundance levels found in human plasma, the array based platform was not. At high miRNA levels both qRT-PCR based platforms performed well in terms of specificity, reproducibility and recovery. At low miRNA levels, as in plasma, the miRCURY platform showed better sensitivity and linearity than the TaqMan platform.Conclusion: For profiling clinical samples with low miRNA abundance, such as plasma samples, the miRCURY platform with its better sensitivity and linearity would probably be superior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Jensen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature on diagnostic criteria is provided, and treatment options and management of adverse events are summarized. Results: Patients with symptomatic disease and organ damage (ie, hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, or bone lesions) require immediate treatment. The International Staging System and chromosomal abnormalities identify high- and standard-risk patients. Proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, corticosteroids, and alkylating agents are the most active agents. The presence of concomitant diseases, frailty, or disability should be assessed and, if present, treated with reduced-dose approaches. Bone disease, renal damage, hematologic toxicities, infections, thromboembolism, and peripheral neuropathy are the most frequent disabling events requiring prompt and active supportive care.

These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.},

The International Myeloma Working Group together with the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network, the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation convened a meeting of MM experts to: (1) summarize current knowledge regarding the role of autologous or allogeneic HCT in MM patients progressing after primary therapy, (2) propose guidelines for the use of salvage HCT in MM, (3) identify knowledge gaps, (4) propose a research agenda, and (5) develop a collaborative initiative to move the research agenda forward. After reviewing the available data, the expert committee came to the following consensus statement for salvage autologous HCT: (1) In transplantation-eligible patients relapsing after primary therapy that did NOT include an autologous HCT, high-dose therapy with HCT as part of salvage therapy should be considered standard; (2) High-dose therapy and autologous HCT should be considered appropriate therapy for any patients relapsing after primary therapy that includes an autologous HCT with initial remission duration of more than 18 months; (3) High-dose therapy and autologous HCT can be used as a bridging strategy to allogeneic HCT; (4) The role of postsalvage HCT maintenance needs to be explored in the context of well-designed prospective trials that should include new agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, immune-modulating agents, and oral proteasome inhibitors; (5) Autologous HCT consolidation should be explored as a strategy to develop novel conditioning regimens or post-HCT strategies in patients with short (less than 18 months remissions) after primary therapy; and (6) Prospective randomized trials need to be performed to define the role of salvage autologous HCT in patients with MM relapsing after primary therapy comparing it to "best non-HCT" therapy. The expert committee also underscored the importance of collecting enough hematopoietic stem cells to perform 2 transplantations early in the course of the disease. Regarding allogeneic HCT, the expert committee agreed on the following consensus statements: (1) Allogeneic HCT should be considered appropriate therapy for any eligible patient with early relapse (less than 24 months) after primary therapy that included an autologous HCT and/or high-risk features (ie, cytogenetics, extramedullary disease, plasma cell leukemia, or high lactate dehydrogenase); (2) Allogeneic HCT should be performed in the context of a clinical trial if possible; (3) The role of postallogeneic HCT maintenance therapy needs to be explored in the context of well-designed prospective trials; and (4) Prospective randomized trials need to be performed to define the role salvage allogeneic HCT in patients with MM relapsing after primary therapy.},

abstract = {Treatment of multiple myeloma has substantially changed over the past decade with the introduction of several classes of new effective drugs that have greatly improved the rates and depth of response. Response criteria in multiple myeloma were developed to use serum and urine assessment of monoclonal proteins and bone marrow assessment (which is relatively insensitive). Given the high rates of complete response seen in patients with multiple myeloma with new treatment approaches, new response categories need to be defined that can identify responses that are deeper than those conventionally defined as complete response. Recent attempts have focused on the identification of residual tumour cells in the bone marrow using flow cytometry or gene sequencing. Furthermore, sensitive imaging techniques can be used to detect the presence of residual disease outside of the bone marrow. Combining these new methods, the International Myeloma Working Group has defined new response categories of minimal residual disease negativity, with or without imaging-based absence of extramedullary disease, to allow uniform reporting within and outside clinical trials. In this Review, we clarify several aspects of disease response assessment, along with endpoints for clinical trials, and highlight future directions for disease response assessments.},

Results: Serum beta 2-microglobulin (S$\beta$ 2M), serum albumin, platelet count, serum creatinine, and age emerged as powerful predictors of survival and were then used in the tree analysis approach. A combination of S$\beta$ 2M and serum albumin provided the simplest, most powerful and reproducible three-stage classification. This new International Staging System (ISS) was validated in the remaining patients and consists of the following stages: stage I, S$\beta$ 2M less than 3.5 mg/L plus serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL (median survival, 62 months); stage II, neither stage I nor III (median survival, 44 months); and stage III, S$\beta$ 2M {\textgreater} 5.5 mg/L (median survival, 29 months). The ISS system was further validated by demonstrating effectiveness in patients in North America, Europe, and Asia; in patients less than and ≥ 65 years of age; in patients with standard therapy or autotransplantation; and in comparison with the Durie/ Salmon staging system. Conclusion: The new ISS is simple, based on easy to use variables (S$\beta$ 2M and serum albumin), and recommended for early adoption and widespread use. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {Purpose: The clinical outcome of multiple myeloma (MM) is heterogeneous. A simple and reliable tool is needed to stratify patients with MM. We combined the International Staging System (ISS) with chromosomal abnormalities (CA) detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization after CD138 plasma cell purification and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to evaluate their prognostic value in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM). Patients and Methods: Clinical and laboratory data from 4,445 patients with NDMM enrolled onto 11 international trials were pooled together. The K-adaptive partitioning algorithm was used to define the most appropriate subgroups with homogeneous survival. Results: ISS, CA, and LDH data were simultaneously available in 3,060 of 4,445 patients. We defined the following three groups: revised ISS (R-ISS) I (n = 871), including ISS stage I (serum $\beta$2-microglobulin level {\textless} 3.5 mg/L and serum albumin level ≥ 3.5 g/dL), no high-risk CA [del(17p) and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16)], and normal LDH level (less than the upper limit of normal range); R-ISS III (n = 295), including ISS stage III (serum $\beta$2-microglobulin level {\textgreater} 5.5 mg/L) and high-risk CA or high LDH level; and R-ISS II (n = 1,894), including all the other possible combinations. At a median follow-up of 46 months, the 5-year OS rate was 82{\%} in the R-ISS I, 62{\%} in the R-ISS II, and 40{\%} in the R-ISS III groups; the 5-year PFS rates were 55{\%}, 36{\%}, and 24{\%}, respectively. Conclusion: The R-ISS is a simple and powerful prognostic staging system, and we recommend its use in future clinical studies to stratify patients with NDMM effectively with respect to the relative risk to their survival.},

abstract = {This International Myeloma Working Group consensus updates the disease definition of multiple myeloma to include validated biomarkers in addition to existing requirements of attributable CRAB features (hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, and bone lesions). These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.},

abstract = {Recent studies posit a role for non-coding RNAs in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Combining small RNA sequencing from 179 human serum samples with a neural network analysis produced a miRNA algorithm for diagnosis of EOC (AUC 0.90; 95{\%} CI: 0.81-0.99). The model significantly outperformed CA125 and functioned well regardless of patient age, histology, or stage. Among 454 patients with various diagnoses, the miRNA neural network had 100{\%} specificity for ovarian cancer. After using 325 samples to adapt the neural network to qPCR measurements, the model was validated using 51 independent clinical samples, with a positive predictive value of 91.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 73.3-97.6{\%}) and negative predictive value of 78.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 64.2-88.2{\%}). Finally, biologic relevance was tested using in situ hybridization on 30 pre-metastatic lesions, showing intratumoral concentration of relevant miRNAs. These data suggest circulating miRNAs have potential to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the reliability of the standard planimetric methodology of volumetric analysis and three different open-source semi-automated approaches of brain tumor segmentation. Materials and methods: The volumes of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) examined by 30 MRI studies of 10 patients from a previous everolimus-related trial (EMINENTS study) were estimated using four methods: planimetric method (modified MacDonald ellipsoid method), ITK-Snap (pixel clustering, geodesic active contours, region competition methods), 3D Slicer (level-set thresholding), and NIRFast (k-means clustering, Markov random fields). The methods were compared, and a trial simulation was performed to determine how the choice of approach could influence the final decision about progression or response. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient was high (0.95; 95{\%} CI 0.91–0.98). The planimetric method always overestimated the size of the tumor, while virtually no mean difference was found between ITK-Snap and 3D Slicer (P = 0.99). NIRFast underestimated the volume and presented a proportional bias. During the trial simulation, a moderate level of agreement between all the methods (kappa 0.57–0.71, P {\textless} 0.002) was noted. Conclusion: Semi-automated segmentation can ease oncological follow-up but the moderate level of agreement between segmentation methods suggests that the reference standard volumetric method for SEGA tumors should be revised and chosen carefully, as the selection of volumetry tool may influence the conclusion about tumor progression or response.},

abstract = {Objective: One of the therapeutic options for patients with tuberous sclerosis (TCS) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is everolimus treatment once daily, every day, to attain trough concentrations of 5–15 ng/ml (standard treatment). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a reduced dose of everolimus (three times a week with a daily dose as in standard treatment—maintenance therapy) in a group of patients who were previously treated with standard dose for at least 12 months. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (six males, four females; median age 14.23 years) with TSC-related SEGA who met inclusion criteria were included into a single-arm, prospective trial. All the patients were followed over at least 12 months (median 12 and range 12–24 months). Tumor volumes from day 0, 90, 180, and 360 were evaluated by an experienced radiologist and an objective computer-based method and compared. Adverse events (AEs) noted during maintenance therapy were compared to the AEs observed during standard everolimus therapy. Results: The differences in SEGA volume between subsequent time points (day 0, 90, 120, and 360) were not statistically significant. No clinical symptoms of tumor regrowth were observed. AEs were significantly less severe and less frequent during maintenance compared with standard therapy. Conclusions: Maintenance therapy with reduced-dose everolimus is an effective therapeutic option for patients with TSC and SEGA after the completion of standard therapy and may moderate the rates of adverse effects.},

Objective: The aim of our study was to develop novel, accurate machine learning-based methods of insulin resistance estimation in children with type 1 diabetes. Methods: A hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp study was performed to evaluate the glucose disposal rate (GDR) in a study group consisting of 315 patients aged 7.6 to 19.7 years. The group was randomly divided into a training and independent testing set for model performance assessment. GDR was estimated on the basis of simple clinical variables using 2 non-linear methods: artificial neural networks (ANN) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSplines). The results were compared against the most frequently used predictive model, based on waist circumference, triglyceride (TG), and HbA1c levels. Results: The reference model showed moderate performance (R 2 = 0.26) with a median absolute percentage error of 49.1{\%}, and with the worst fit observed in young (7-12 years) children (R 2 = 0.17). Predictions of the MARSplines model were significantly more accurate than those of the reference model (median error 3.6{\%}, R 2 = 0.44 P {\textless}.0001). The predictions of the ANN, however, showed significantly lower error than those of the reference model (P {\textless}.0001) and MARSplines (P {\textless}.0001) and better fit regardless of patient age. ANN-estimated GDRs were within a ±20{\%} error range in 75{\%} of cases with a median error of 0.6{\%} and an R 2 = 0.66. The predictive tool is available at http://link.konsta.com.pl/gdr. Conclusions: The developed GDR estimation model reliant on ANN allows for an optimized prediction of GDR for research and clinical purposes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. The 5-year survival rate for intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has remained at 4-5{\%} for the last 30 years, in spite of multiple randomized prospective trials. The authors hypothesized, based on the literature, that even this remarkably poor survival rate is an overstatement. They investigated this hypothesis using the the Duke University Medical Center Tumor Registry. METHODS. The authors reviewed all patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GBM recorded in the Duke University Medical Center Tumor Registry from the registry's inception in 1976 through 1996. This search identified a population of patients with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. Each of the long-term survivors was assigned a code number for clinical information. The pathology slides were provided to a neuropathologist in a coded fashion so that the patients could not be identified. The neuropathologist reviewed the slides to analyze the presence or absence of nine histologic factors. A match technique was used to identify a control population of patients with GBM who were not 5-year survivors and were all deceased. The control population was compared with the study population to ascertain if there are histologic correlates associated with long-term survivorship. RESULTS. The authors identified 766 patients recorded by the tumor registry as having an intracranial GBM with a minimum of 5 years of follow up. Of the total population, 32 patients initially appeared to be 5-year survivors (4{\%}). Upon review of the medical records for these 32 patients, however, the authors found only 17 patients who were truly 5-year survivors. The most common reason for miscoding was the presence of a low-grade astrocytoma that subsequently dedifferentiated into GBM. The 17 long-term survivors included 11 males and 6 females. Their mean age at diagnosis was 40.2 years. Therapy consisted of a macroscopic total resection in 4 patients (22{\%}), a biopsy in 1 patient (6{\%}), a subtotal resection in 10 patients (56{\%}), and unknown extent of resection in 2 patients (11{\%}). All patients received partial brain irradiation (mean dose, 62. 6 Gy) and chemotherapy. Thirteen different single-agent or combination chemotherapy programs were used. Two patients also received 1-131 monoclonal antibody therapy. Analysis of the nine histopathologic factors studied showed that intermediate fibrillary elements were more common and small anaplastic elements were less common in the long-term survivors than in the control population. CONCLUSIONS. Survival data on intracranial GBM, based on tumor registry data, should be interpreted cautiously. Reliable conclusions can only be drawn when such data are supplemented with clinical information and the histopathology is reviewed carefully. The group of long-term survivors in the current study were younger than the typical GBM population. Conventionally treated patients with GBM, chosen from an unselected population from a tumor registry, have a smaller chance of long-term survival than is generally believed. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Cancer Society.},

Results: Results revealed a median survival of 13.41-19 months in the combined treatment group, as opposed to 7.7-17.1 months in the RT-alone group. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also significantly different between the 2 groups (RT + TMZ, 6.3-13 months; RT-alone, 5-7.6 months). While there was no significant difference in the 6-month survival and 6-month PFS rates between the RT + TMZ and RT groups (pooled OR 0.690; p = 0.057 and OR 0.429, p = 0.052, respectively), the 1-year survival and 1-year PFS rates showed significant difference (OR 0.469; p = 0.030 and OR 0.245, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively).

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate radiotherapy/temozolomide (TMZ) versus radiotherapy for treating newly diagnosed GBM. Materials and Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CNKI) were searched for relevant publications up to November 05, 2014. RevMan version 5.2 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 9 studies were identified in this analyses, which included 986 patients. The summary risk ratio (RR) for overall survival and the progression-free survival (PFS) was the measure of interest. Results revealed that the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit in poor prognosis patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (RR = 2.93 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 2.29, 3.75], P {\textless} 0.00001).

This study aims to figure out signatures for predicting the survival time of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Clinical information, messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, and single-nucleotide polymorphism array data of patients with glioblastoma multiforme were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Patients were separated into two groups by using 1 year as a cutoff, and a logistic regression model was used to figure out any variables that can predict whether the patient was able to live longer than 1 year. Furthermore, Cox's model was used to find out features that were correlated with the survival time. Finally, a Cox model integrated the significant clinical variables, messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, and single-nucleotide polymorphism was built. Although the classification method failed, signatures of clinical features, messenger RNA expression levels, and microRNA expression levels were figured out by using Cox's model. However, no single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to prognosis were found. The selected clinical features were age at initial diagnosis, Karnofsky score, and race, all of which had been suggested to correlate with survival time. Both of the two significant microRNAs, microRNA-221 and microRNA-222, were targeted to p27Kip1 protein, which implied the important role of p27Kip1 on the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme patients. Our results suggested that survival modeling was more suitable than classification to figure out prognostic biomarkers for patients with glioblastoma multiforme. An integrated model containing clinical features, messenger RNA levels, and microRNA expression levels was built, which has the potential to be used in clinics and thus to improve the survival status of glioblastoma multiforme patients.},

abstract = {Background: Precisely defining the number and location of brain metastases is very important for establishing a treatment strategy for malignancies. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now considered the best modality, various improvements in sequences are still being made. Purpose: To prospectively compare the diagnostic ability of three-dimensional, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (3D MP-RAGE) imaging in detecting metastatic brain tumors, with that of two-dimensional spin-echo (2D SE) T1-weighted imaging. Material and Methods: A total of 123 examinations were included in this study, and 119 examinations from 88 patients with known malignancies were analyzed. All patients underwent T1- and T2-weighted 2D SE transverse imaging, followed by gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted transverse and coronal 2D SE imaging and 3D MP-RAGE transverse imaging. Four radiologists interpreted the images to compare the accuracy and the time required for interpretation for each imaging. Results: 3D MP-RAGE imaging was significantly better than 2D SE imaging for detecting metastatic brain lesions, regardless of the readers' experience. The sensitivities of the 3D MP-RAGE and 2D SE imaging for all observers were 0.81 vs. 0.80 (P{\textgreater}0.05), specificities were 0.93 vs. 0.87 (P{\textless}0.05), positive predictive values were 0.92 vs. 0.86 (P{\textless}0.05), negative predictive values were 0.78 vs. 0.75 (P{\textgreater}0.05), and accuracies were 0.84 vs. 0.78 (P{\textless}0.05), respectively. There was no significant difference in the time required for image interpretation between the two modalities (15.6±4.0 vs. 15.4±4.1 min). Conclusion: 3D MP-RAGE imaging proved superior to 2D SE imaging in the detection of brain metastases. {\textcopyright} 2008 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on gradient echoes is used in a wide variety of imaging techniques and clinical applications. Gradient echo sequences form the basis for an essential group of imaging methods that find widespread use in clinical practice, particularly when fast imaging is important, as for example in cardiac MRI or contrast-enhanced MR angiography. However, the term "gradient echo sequence" is somewhat unspecific, as even images acquired with the most common sequences employing the gradient echo for data acquisition can significantly differ in signal, contrast, artifact behavior, and sensitivity to, eg, flow. This is due to the different use of sequence timing and basic sequence building blocks such as spoiler gradients or specific radiofrequency (RF) pulse phase patterns. In this article the basic principles of gradient echo formation compared to spin echo imaging are reviewed and the properties of gradient echo imaging in its simplest form (TR ≤laquo; T2) are described. Further, the most common three variants of fast gradient echo sequences (TR {\textless} T2), namely, unbalanced gradient echo, RF spoiled gradient echo, and balanced steady state free precession; are discussed. For each gradient echo sequence type, examples of applications exploiting the specific properties of the individual technique are presented. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T1-weighted, 3D gradient-echo MR sequences can be optimized for rapid acquisition and improved resolution through asymmetric k-space sampling and interpolation. We compared a volumetric interpolated brain examination (VIBE) sequence with a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP RAGE) sequence and a 2D T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients known or suspected to have focal brain lesions underwent postcontrast studies (20 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine) with VIBE, MP RAGE, and 2D T1-weighted SE imaging. Source and 5-mm VIBE and MP RAGE reformations, and 5-mm T1-weighted SE images were compared qualitatively and by using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). SNRs in a gadolinium-doped water phantom were also measured for all three sequences. RESULTS: On the source images, SNRs for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and CNRs for WM-to-GM and contrast-enhancing lesion-to-GM were slightly, but significantly higher for the VIBE sequence than for the MP RAGE sequence (P {\textless} .05). On 5-mm reformations, WM-to-GM CNR was significantly higher on VIBE and MP RAGE images than on T1-weighted SE images (P {\textless} .001), but contrast-enhancing lesion-to-GM CNRs were higher on SE images compared with both gradient-echo sequences (P {\textless} .001). Qualitatively, VIBE images showed fewer flow artifacts than did SE and MP RAGE images (P {\textless} .05). In the phantom, VIBE SNR was higher than MP RAGE SNR for short T1 relaxation times. CONCLUSION: VIBE provides an effective, alternative approach to MP RAGE for fast 3D T1-weighted imaging of the brain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In multiple sclerosis, gadolinium enhancement is used to classify lesions as active. Regarding the need for a standardized and accurate method for detection of multiple sclerosis activity, we compared 2D-spin-echo with 3D-gradient-echo T1WI for the detection of gadolinium-enhancing MS lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with MS were prospectively imaged at 3T by using both 2D-spin-echo and 3D-gradient recalled-echo T1WI in random order after the injection of gadolinium. Blinded and independent evaluation was performed by a junior and a senior reader to count gadolinium-enhancing lesions and to characterize their location, size, pattern of enhancement, and the relative contrast between enhancing lesions and the adjacent white matter. Finally, the SNR and relative contrast of gadolinium-enhancing lesions were computed for both sequences by using simulations. RESULTS: Significantly more gadolinium-enhancing lesions were reported on 3D-gradient recalled-echo than on 2D-spin-echo (n = 59 versus n = 30 for the junior reader, P = .021; n = 77 versus n = 61 for the senior reader, P = .017). The difference between the 2 readers was significant on 2D-spin-echo (P = .044), for which images were less reproducible ($\kappa$ = 0.51) than for 3D-gradient recalled-echo ($\kappa$ = 0.65). Further comparisons showed that there were statistically more small lesions ({\textless}5 mm) on 3D-gradient recalled-echo than on 2D-spin-echo (P = .04), while other features were similar. Theoretic results from simulations predicted SNR and lesion contrast for 3D-gradient recalled-echo to be better than for 2D-spin-echo for visualization of small enhancing lesions and were, therefore, consistent with clinical observations. CONCLUSIONS: At 3T, 3D-gradient recalled-echo provides a higher detection rate of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, especially those with smaller size, with a better reproducibility; this finding suggests using 3D-gradient recalled-echo to detect MS activity, with potential impact in initiation, monitoring, and optimization of therapy.},

abstract = {Background: In Germany, data on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) under therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are limited. Objectives: Androgen deprivation (ADT) is a palliative therapy for patients with advanced PCa, which is given over long periods and usually continued in combination with other therapies even after progression of the disease. The present study aimed to assess prospectively (over 1 year) different aspects of patients' QoL therapy with triptorelin in daily practice. Patients and methods: This prospective, noninterventional study at 129 centers in Germany included 608 patients with advanced PCa treated with triptorelin. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, using validated EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed to assess the impact of demographics, anamnestic and clinical parameters on QoL. Results and discussion: The majority of patients with PCa under therapy with triptorelin showed generally stable global QoL over 1 year; approximately one-quarters of the patients had a clinically relevant improvement of their global QoL. In patients without previous PCa therapy and GnRH analogue treatment, significant improvements in global QoL were seen. At the same time, these patients also reported increased treatment-related symptoms. These data indicate that the perception of global QoL is not only influenced by subjective impairment through ADT-related side effects.},

Hyperglycemic clamp technique. The plasma glucose concentration is acutely raised to 125 mg/dl above basal levels by a priming infusion of glucose. The desired hyperglycemic plateau is subsequently maintained by adjustment of a variable glucose infusion, based on the negative feedback principle. Because the plasma glucose concentration is held constant, the glucose infusion rate is an index of glucose metabolism. Under these conditions of constant hyperglycemia, the plasma insulin response is biphasic with an early burst of insulin release during the first 6 min followed by a gradually progressive increase in plasma insulin concentration. Euglycemic insulin clamp technique. The plasma insulin concentration is acutely raised and maintained at approximately 100 $\mu$U/ml by a prime-continuous infusion of insulin. The plasma glucose concentration is held constant at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion using the negative feedback principle. Under these steady-state conditions of euglycemia, the glucose infusion rate equals glucose uptake by all the tissues in the body and is therefore a measure of tissue sensitivity to exogenous insulin.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the reliability of the standard planimetric methodology of volumetric analysis and three different open-source semi-automated approaches of brain tumor segmentation. Materials and methods: The volumes of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) examined by 30 MRI studies of 10 patients from a previous everolimus-related trial (EMINENTS study) were estimated using four methods: planimetric method (modified MacDonald ellipsoid method), ITK-Snap (pixel clustering, geodesic active contours, region competition methods), 3D Slicer (level-set thresholding), and NIRFast (k-means clustering, Markov random fields). The methods were compared, and a trial simulation was performed to determine how the choice of approach could influence the final decision about progression or response. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient was high (0.95; 95{\%} CI 0.91–0.98). The planimetric method always overestimated the size of the tumor, while virtually no mean difference was found between ITK-Snap and 3D Slicer (P = 0.99). NIRFast underestimated the volume and presented a proportional bias. During the trial simulation, a moderate level of agreement between all the methods (kappa 0.57–0.71, P {\textless} 0.002) was noted. Conclusion: Semi-automated segmentation can ease oncological follow-up but the moderate level of agreement between segmentation methods suggests that the reference standard volumetric method for SEGA tumors should be revised and chosen carefully, as the selection of volumetry tool may influence the conclusion about tumor progression or response.},

Objective To determine prognostic factors in NMIBC patients treated with 1-3 yr of BCG after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), to derive nomograms and risk groups, and to identify high-risk patients who should be considered for early cystectomy. Design, setting, and participants Data for 1812 patients were merged from two European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer randomized phase 3 trials in intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC. Intervention Patients received 1-3 yr of maintenance BCG after TURB and induction BCG. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Prognostic factors for risk of early recurrence and times to late recurrence, progression, and death were identified in a training data set using multivariable models and applied to a validation data set. Results and limitations With a median follow-up of 7.4 yr, 762 patients recurred; 173 progressed; and 520 died, 83 due to bladder cancer (BCa). Statistically significant prognostic factors identified by multivariable analyses were prior recurrence rate and number of tumors for recurrence, and tumor stage and grade for progression and death due to BCa. T1G3 patients do poorly, with 1- and 5-yr disease-progression rates of 11.4{\%} and 19.8{\%}, respectively, and 1- and 5-yr disease-specific death rates of 4.8{\%} and 11.3{\%}. Limitations include lack of repeat transurethral resection in high-risk patients and exclusion of patients with carcinoma in situ.

abstract = {Using population-based cancer registries data, we examined incidence and survival patterns of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL), and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) patients. Blacks with CLL/SLL present at younger age, more advanced stage, and have inferior survival compared to Whites. Male gender and black race predicted worse survival among CLL patients, but had lesser impact on PLL outcomes. Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukemia in the United States, and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) is a related, rare chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Methods: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data from 13 registries, we examined differences in incidence and survival for CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and PLL by race. International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3rd edition histology codes 9670, 9823, and 9632-34 were used to identify cases. Results: From 1992 to 2007, 30,622 cases of CLL/SLL and 268 cases of PLL were recorded. Males had higher incidence than females (male-to-female incidence rate ratio CLL/SLL 1.89, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.85-1.94 and PLL 2.47, 95{\%}CI 1.90-3.20). Black patients were diagnosed at younger age compared to white patients (mean age at diagnosis for white versus black patients for CLL/SLL, 70 versus 67 years, P {\textless} .001; for PLL, 71 versus 61 years, P {\textless} .001). Greater proportion of black patients with SLL presented with B symptoms, extranodal primary site, and advanced disease compared to white patients (P = .003, P = .012, and P = .009 respectively). White patients with CLL/SLL had better survival rates than black patients (5-year relative survival rate 77.1{\%} versus 63.9{\%}, P {\textless} .01). In univariate Cox regression models, black race, male gender, age at diagnosis {\textgreater} 65 years, advanced stage, and B-symptoms were predictors of worse survival (P {\textless}.01) among CLL/SLL patients. Conclusions: Black patients with CLL/SLL and PLL present at younger age and black patients with CLL/SLL have worse survival than white patients. Epidemiological studies examining the biological variants of these diseases in concert with race are needed to elucidate the etiology of these disparities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background Idelalisib, a selective inhibitor of PI3K$\delta$, is approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in combination with rituximab. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of idelalisib in combination with a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody, ofatumumab, in a similar patient population. Methods In this global, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed CLL progressing less than 24 months from last therapy. Patients refractory to ofatumumab were excluded. Patients were stratified by relapsed versus refractory disease, presence or absence of del(17p) or TP53 mutation, or both, and IGHV mutated versus unmutated. We randomised patients in a 2:1 ratio using a web-based interactive system that generated a unique treatment code, and assigned patients to receive either idelalisib plus ofatumumab (oral idelalisib 150 mg twice daily continuously plus ofatumumab 300 mg intravenously in week 1, then 1000 mg intravenously weekly for 7 weeks, and every 4 weeks for 16 weeks) or ofatumumab alone (ofatumumab dosing as per the combination group, except 2000 mg was substituted for the 1000 mg dose). An independent review committee assessed response, including progressive disease, based on imaging using modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 2008 criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. We did a primary analysis (data cutoff Jan 15, 2015) and an updated analysis (data cutoff Sept 1, 2015). This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01659021. Findings Between Dec 17, 2012, and March 31, 2014, we enrolled 261 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 61–74], median previous therapies three [IQR 2–4]). At the primary analysis, median progression-free survival was 16{\textperiodcentered}3 months (95{\%} CI 13{\textperiodcentered}6–17{\textperiodcentered}8) in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group and 8{\textperiodcentered}0 months (5{\textperiodcentered}7–8{\textperiodcentered}2) in the ofatumumab group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}27, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}19–0{\textperiodcentered}39, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group were neutropenia (59 [34{\%}] patients vs 14 [16{\%}] in the ofatumumab group), diarrhoea (34 [20{\%}] vs one [1{\%}]), and pneumonia (25 [14{\%}] vs seven [8{\%}]). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the ofatumumab group were neutropenia (14 [16{\%}]), pneumonia (seven [8{\%}]), and thrombocytopenia (six [7{\%}] vs 19 [11{\%}] in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group). Serious infections were more common in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group and included pneumonia (23 [13{\%}] patients in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group vs nine [10{\%}] in the ofatumumab group), sepsis (11 [6{\%}] vs one [1{\%}]), and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (eight [5{\%}] vs one [1{\%}]). 22 treatment-related deaths occurred in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group (the most common being sepsis, septic shock, viral sepsis, and pneumonia). Six treatment-related deaths occurred in the ofatumumab group (the most common being progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and pneumonia). Interpretation The idelalisib plus ofatumumab combination resulted in better progression-free survival compared with ofatumumab alone in patients with relapsed CLL, including in those with high-risk disease, and thus might represent a new treatment alternative for this patient population.

abstract = {Three agents have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) within the past year. Ibrutinib and idelalisib block B-cell receptor signaling through inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase $\delta$ molecules respectively, interfering with several pathways required for leukemia cell survival. Idelalisib has shown efficacy in the relapsed setting and is currently approved by the FDA for use in combination with rituximab. Ibrutinib has been studied in patients with relapsed CLL and as frontline therapy. In the relapsed setting, these agents produce durable remissions, and might be preferable to re-treatment with chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. Ibrutinib is also effective treatment for patients with deletion 17p and is approved by the FDA as frontline therapy in this patient group, although it does not appear to completely abrogate this adverse prognostic factor. These agents have a unique side effect profile and longer follow-up is required to further understand tolerability and rare adverse effects. Obinutuzumab is a type-2 monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which results in direct and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of leukemia cells. It is approved by the FDA for use in combination with chlorambucil, and has shown efficacy in the frontline setting in patients unfit for more intensive chemoimmunotherapy. It produces increased response rates and minimal residual disease negativity compared with chlorambucil/rituximab and is associated with an advantage in progression-free survival but not yet overall survival. These agents underscore our advancement in the understanding of the biology of CLL and will improve outcomes for many patients with CLL.},

Patients were treated at 6 dose levels of oral idelalisib (range 50-350 mg once or twice daily) and remained on continuous therapy while deriving clinical benefit. Idelalisib-mediated inhibition of PI3Kd led to abrogation of Akt phosphorylation in patient CLL cells and significantly reduced serum levels of CLL-related chemokines. The most commonly observed grade ≥3 adverse events were pneumonia (20{\%}), neutropenic fever (11{\%}), and diarrhea (6{\%}). Idelalisib treatment resulted in nodal responses in 81{\%} of patients.

abstract = {Purpose: Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, once-daily, oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase, promotes apoptosis, and inhibits B-cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Ibrutinib has demonstrated single-agent efficacy and acceptable tolerability at doses of 420 and 840 mg in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who were treatment-na{\"{i}}ve (TN) or had relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL after ≥1 prior therapy in a phase Ib/II study (PCYC-1102). Subsequently, the ibrutinib 420 mg dose was approved in CLL. Experimental Design: We report data with 44 months of follow-up on 94 patients with TN and R/R CLL/SLL receiving ibrutinib 420 mg once-daily in PCYC-1102 and the long-term extension study PCYC-1103. Results: Ninety-four CLL/SLL patients (27 TN, 67 R/R) were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg/day). Patients with R/R disease had received a median of four prior therapies (range, 1-12). Responses were rapid and durable and median duration of response was not reached. Best overall response was 91{\%} [85{\%} TN (complete response, CR 26{\%}) and 94{\%} R/R (9{\%} CR)]. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached in either group. The 30-month PFS rate was 96{\%} and 76{\%} for TN and R/R patients, respectively. Ibrutinib was well tolerated with extended follow-up; rates of grade ≥3 cytopenias and fatigue, as well as discontinuations due to toxicities decreased over time. Conclusions: Single-agent ibrutinib at 420 mg once-daily resulted in durable responses and was well tolerated with up to 44 months follow-up in patients with TN and R/R CLL/SLL. Currently, 66{\%} of patients continue on ibrutinib.},

abstract = {Normal B lymphocytes receive signals from B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) that are triggered by binding of the BCR to an external antigen. Tonic signaling through the BCR provides growth and signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Antigen engagement of BCR is followed by intracellular recruitment and activation of BCR-associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K). Inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of the BCR induces disruption of chemokine-mediated CLL cell migration and cell killing. BCR signal transduction inhibitors represent a promising new strategy for targeted CLL treatment. A number of therapeutic agents have recently been developed with significant activity in CLL. The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib-inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101)-a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor. The clinical activity of ibrutinib, GS-1101 and fostamatinib in patients with CLL is associated with marked lymphocytosis due to release of tumor cells from the lymph nodes into the peripheral blood. Further studies are ongoing with single agents and their combinations with other targeted and conventional therapies. This article will review the preclinical rationale of BCR signaling inhibitors in the treatment of CLL, and the clinical evidence supporting the use of these agents in CLL patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable leukemia characterized by the slow but progressive accumulation of cells in a CD5+ B-cell clone. Like the nonmalignant counterparts, B-1 cells, CLL cells often express surface immunoglobulin with the capacity to bind autologous structures. Previously there has been no established link between antigen-receptor binding and inhibition of apoptosis in CLL. In this work, using primary CLL cells from untreated patients with this disease, it is demonstrated that engagement of surface IgM elicits a powerful survival program. The response includes inhibition of caspase activity, activation of NF-$\kappa$B, and expression of mcl-1, bcl-2, and bfl-1 in the tumor cells. Blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pl3-K), a critical mediator of signals through the antigen receptor, completely abrogated mcl-1 induction and impaired survival in the stimulated cells. These data support the contention that CLL cell survival is promoted by antigen for which the malignant clone has affinity, and suggest that pharmacologic interference with antigen-receptor-derived signals has potential for therapy in patients with CLL. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

In addition, it has been associated with the development of myelosuppression and secondary neoplasms; treatments are hence needed which offer greater survival and lowered toxicity. A range of new targeted agents, ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax, have demonstrated such a balance in a second-line setting, offering CLL patients durable remissions and a modest toxicity profile. Ibrutinib has since been given first-line approval, and with news of second-generation targeted agents on the horizon, high-level discussions have taken place concerning their use in elderly or unfit patients; with potential use in younger patients in a first-line setting. This article reviews the potential first-line therapeutic options for treating CLL and their clinical potential and examines whether first-line chemotherapy has a place in the age of targeted agents.},

Incidence data were collected by the National Cancer Institute (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] Program), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (National Program of Cancer Registries), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2016, 1,685,210 new cancer cases and 595,690 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Overall cancer incidence trends (13 oldest SEER registries) are stable in women, but declining by 3.1{\%} per year in men (from 2009-2012), much of which is because of recent rapid declines in prostate cancer diagnoses. The cancer death rate has dropped by 23{\%} since 1991, translating to more than 1.7 million deaths averted through 2012. Despite this progress, death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and uterine corpus, and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states, primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease. Among children and adolescents (aged birth-19 years), brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death because of the dramatic therapeutic advances against leukemia. Accelerating progress against cancer requires both increased national investment in cancer research and the application of existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

The Cancer Registry of Norway has registered data on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia since 1953. We aimed to analyze trends in incidence and survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Norway. We identified 7664 patients reported with chronic lymphocytic leukemia to the registry between 1953 and 2012. We gathered information on sex, age at diagnosis, date of death and basis for diagnosis. The age-standardized incidence increased from 0.6/100.000 person-years in 1953 to 3.1/100,000 person-years in 2012. We found a significant decrease in median age between 1993–2002 and 2003–2012 (75 vs. 72 years, 95{\%}CI: 2.52–3.98, P {\textless} 0.001). Men were diagnosed at a significantly younger age than women. Immunophenotyping has become the most important diagnostic method after 2002. Median observed survival increased from 3 years in 1952–1963 to 8.5 years in 2003–2012. Five- and 10-year age-standardized net survival increased throughout the whole period across age groups and reached 79{\%} and 57{\%}, respectively. Median observed survival was significantly shorter in men than in women in 1993–2002 (4.9 vs. 6.1 years, P {\textless} 0.001). The gap between survival rates for men and women was diminishing in 2003–2012 in patients younger than 60 years while it remained considerable in older patients. Despite an aging Norwegian population, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients become younger at diagnosis. A fourfold increase in incidence, a prolonged survival, and major changes in diagnostic methods in Norway were observed.},

abstract = {Background On the basis of promising results that were reported in several phase 2 trials, we investigated whether the addition of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to first-line chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide would improve the outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods Treatment-naive, physically fit patients (aged 30-81 years) with CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} per day) for the first 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without rituximab (375 mg/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} on day 0 of first course, and 500 mg/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} on day 1 of second to sixth courses) in 190 centres in 11 countries. Investigators and patients were not masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00281918. Findings 408 patients were assigned to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy group) and 409 to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy group); all patients were analysed. At 3 years after randomisation, 65 of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were free of progression compared with 45 in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}56 [95 CI 0{\textperiodcentered}46-0{\textperiodcentered}69], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001); 87 were alive versus 83, respectively (0{\textperiodcentered}67 [0{\textperiodcentered}48-0{\textperiodcentered}92]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}01). Chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (136 [34] of 404 vs 83 [21] of 396; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and leucocytopenia (97 [24] vs 48 [12]; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Other side-effects, including severe infections, were not increased. There were eight (2) treatment-related deaths in the chemoimmunotherapy group compared with ten (3) in the chemotherapy group. Interpretation Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Moreover, the results suggest that the choice of a specific first-line treatment changes the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

We describe the development of a reporting guideline, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015). PRISMA-P consists of a 17-item checklist intended to facilitate the preparation and reporting of a robust protocol for the systematic review.

abstract = {Genomic studies have revealed the complex clonal heterogeneity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The acquisition and selection of genomic aberrations may be critical to understanding the progression of this disease. In this study, we have extensively characterized the mutational status of TP53, SF3B1, BIRC3, NOTCH1, and ATM in 406 untreated CLL cases by ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, which detected subclonal mutations down to 0.3{\%} allele frequency. Clonal dynamics were examined in longitudinal samples of 48 CLL patients. We identified a high proportion of subclonal mutations, isolated or associated with clonal aberrations. TP53 mutations were present in 10.6{\%} of patients (6.4{\%} clonal, 4.2{\%} subclonal), ATM mutations in 11.1{\%} (7.8{\%} clonal, 1.3{\%} subclonal, 2{\%} germ line mutations considered pathogenic), SF3B1 mutations in 12.6{\%} (7.4{\%} clonal, 5.2{\%} subclonal), NOTCH1 mutations in 21.8{\%} (14.2{\%} clonal, 7.6{\%} subclonal), and BIRC3 mutations in 4.2{\%} (2{\%} clonal, 2.2{\%} subclonal). ATM mutations, clonal SF3B1, and both clonal and subclonal NOTCH1 mutations predicted for shorter time to first treatment irrespective of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IGHV) mutational status. Clonal and subclonal TP53 and clonal NOTCH1 mutations predicted for shorter overall survival together with the IGHV mutational status. Clonal evolution in longitudinal samples mainly occurred in cases with mutations in the initial samples and was observed not only after chemotherapy but also in untreated patients. These findings suggest that the characterization of the subclonal architecture and its dynamics in the evolution of the disease may be relevant for the management of CLL patients.},

abstract = {Mental ill health is very common. Most people with mental health problems live in the community, and as many as 1.5 million people in the UK may be involved in caring for a relative or friend with a mental illness or some form of dementia. Recent legislation and policy initiatives such as the National Strategy for Carers, and the National Service Frameworks for Mental Health and Older People emphasise the importance of providing support for this particular group of carers. The present paper reports the findings of a scoping study to identify what the research tells us about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for the carers of people with mental health problems, and also where there are gaps in the knowledge base. Some 204 evaluation studies were included in the review, just 13 of which had an economic component. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA, and were aimed at carers of people with Alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia. Overall, there was a lack of strong evidence to support any specific interventions, although almost all studies were able to identify some positive outcomes of services provided. In contrast to the relatively narrow approach to effectiveness adopted in most of the studies reviewed, the contributors to a consultation exercise perceived this concept in a far more rounded and holistic way. For them, the process of service delivery was as important as the outcome. There was relatively little research evaluating interventions and services singled},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progressionfree survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88{\%} at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P{\textless}0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P = 0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90{\%} in the ibrutinib group and 81{\%} in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6{\%} vs. 4.1{\%}, P{\textless}0.001). An additional 20{\%} of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.

A later publication proposed a second look at the results, demonstrating that older patients with ruptured MCA aneurysms appeared to benefit from clipping, in disagreement with the general findings of the trial. Subgroup analyses in randomized trials and observational studies examine whether effects of interventions differ between subgroups according to the characteristics of patients. However, many apparent subgroup effects have been shown to be spurious. Misleading subgroup effects can result in withholding efficacious treatment from patients who would benefit or can encourage ineffective or potentially harmful treatments for patients who would fare better without.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have clinically significant coexisting medical conditions are less able to undergo standard chemotherapy. Effective therapies with acceptable side-effect profiles are needed for this patient population. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of idelalisib, an oral inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. We randomly assigned 220 patients with decreased renal function, previous therapy-induced myelosuppression, or major coexisting illnesses to receive rituximab and either idelalisib (at a dose of 150 mg) or placebo twice daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. At the first prespecified interim analysis, the study was stopped early on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board owing to overwhelming efficacy. RESULTS The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the placebo group and was not reached in the idelalisib group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the idelalisib group, 0.15; P{\textless}0.001). Patients receiving idelalisib versus those receiving placebo had improved rates of overall response (81{\%} vs. 13{\%}; odds ratio, 29.92; P{\textless}0.001) and overall survival at 12 months (92{\%} vs. 80{\%}; hazard ratio for death, 0.28; P=0.02). Serious adverse events occurred in 40{\%} of the patients receiving idelalisib and rituximab and in 35{\%} of those receiving placebo and rituximab. CONCLUSIONS The combination of idelalisib and rituximab, as compared with placebo and rituximab, significantly improved progression-free survival, response rate, and overall survival among patients with relapsed CLL who were less able to undergo chemotherapy.

abstract = {Therapeutic results of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are very disappointing at present. Lenalidomide has been proved to be effective for relapsed/refractory CLL as a single agent or in combination with various chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens. However, current clinical experience in its usage is still limited. Because of existing considerable variability in different studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to describe overall response rate (ORR) of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Pooled estimate of cumulative prevalence of total ORR was 42.23 {\%} (95 {\%} confidence interval [CI], 32.49–52.61 {\%}), while pooled ORR in regimen with lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAbs) and lenalidomide mono-therapy were 60.01 {\%} (95 {\%} CI, 53.86–65.86 {\%}) and 24.38 {\%} (95 {\%} CI, 16.15–35.06 {\%}), respectively. There was no significant difference between L + R (lenalidomide plus rituximab) group and L + O (lenalidomide plus ofatumumab) group, with pooled ORR of 66.38 {\%} (95 {\%} CI, 57.96–73.87 {\%}) and 57.40 {\%} (95 {\%} CI, 46.46–67.65 {\%}), respectively. When co-administrated with anti-CD20 mAbs, dosage of lenalidomide was not the key factor of ORR in combination therapy. Pooled ORR of patient with high-risk cytogenetic in L + anti-CD20 mAbs group was 56.74 {\%} (95 {\%} CI, 45.53–67.30 {\%}). In comparison with patients without high-risk cytogenetic receiving the same treatment regimen, no significant difference was observed, with relative risk (RR) of 0.87 (95 {\%} CI 0.68–1.11). Our finding demonstrated that lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 mAbs could be an efficient therapy regimen for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, especially for those with high-risk cytogenetic factor.},

abstract = {Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is an incurable and chronic disorder, with worsening prognosis for patients as their disease progresses. We compared the efficacy and safety of the combination of fludarabine and alemtuzumab with fludarabine monotherapy in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Methods: Patients (aged ≥18 years) with CLL Binet stage A, B, or C or Rai stages I-IV were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to open-label combination treatment (fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 per day and alemtuzumab 30 mg per day on days 1-3) or monotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 on days 1-5) by use of an interactive voice response system. Both regimens were given intravenously for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00086580. Findings: Fludarabine plus alemtuzumab (n=168) resulted in better PFS than did fludarabine monotherapy (n=167; median 23{\textperiodcentered}7 months [95{\%} CI 19{\textperiodcentered}2-28{\textperiodcentered}4] vs 16{\textperiodcentered}5 months [12{\textperiodcentered}5-21{\textperiodcentered}2]; hazard ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}61 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}47-0{\textperiodcentered}80]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0003) and overall survival (median not reached vs 52{\textperiodcentered}9 months [40{\textperiodcentered}9-not reached]; 0{\textperiodcentered}65 [0{\textperiodcentered}45-0{\textperiodcentered}94]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}021) compared with fludarabine alone. All-cause adverse events occurred in 161 (98{\%}) of 164 patients in the combination treatment group and 149 (90{\%}) of 165 in the fludarabine alone group. Patients in the fludarabine plus alemtuzumab group had more cytomegalovirus events (23 [14{\%}] vs one [{\textless}1{\%}]) and grade 1 or 2 potentially alemtuzumab infusion-related adverse reactions (102 [62{\%}] vs 22 [13{\%}]). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the combination treatment and monotherapy groups were leucopenia (121 [74{\%}] of 164 vs 55 [34{\%}] of 164), lymphopenia (149 [94{\%}] of 158 vs 53 [33{\%}] of 161), neutropenia (93 [59{\%}] of 157 vs 110 [68{\%}] of 161), thrombocytopenia (18 [11{\%}] of 164 vs 27 [17{\%}] of 163), and anaemia (14 [9{\%}] of 163 vs 28 [17{\%}] of 164). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the combination treatment group (54 [33{\%}] of 164 vs 41 [25{\%}] of 165); deaths due to adverse events were similar between the two groups (ten [6{\%}] vs 12 [7{\%}]).

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable leukemia characterized by the slow but progressive accumulation of cells in a CD5+ B-cell clone. Like the nonmalignant counterparts, B-1 cells, CLL cells often express surface immunoglobulin with the capacity to bind autologous structures. Previously there has been no established link between antigen-receptor binding and inhibition of apoptosis in CLL. In this work, using primary CLL cells from untreated patients with this disease, it is demonstrated that engagement of surface IgM elicits a powerful survival program. The response includes inhibition of caspase activity, activation of NF-$\kappa$B, and expression of mcl-1, bcl-2, and bfl-1 in the tumor cells. Blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pl3-K), a critical mediator of signals through the antigen receptor, completely abrogated mcl-1 induction and impaired survival in the stimulated cells. These data support the contention that CLL cell survival is promoted by antigen for which the malignant clone has affinity, and suggest that pharmacologic interference with antigen-receptor-derived signals has potential for therapy in patients with CLL. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Background. Fludarabine is an effective treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia that does not respond to initial treatment with chlorambucil. We compared the efficacy of fludarabine with that of chlorambucil in the primary treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Methods Between 1990 and 1994, we randomly assigned 509 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia to one of the following treatments: fludarabine (25 mg per square meter of body-surface area, administered intravenously dally for 5 days every 28 days), chlorambucil (40 mg per square meter, given orally every 28 days), or fludarabine (20 mg per square meter per day for 5 days every 28 days) plus chlorambucil (20 mg per square meter every 28 days). Patients with an additional response at each monthly evaluation continued to receive the assigned treatment for a maximum of 12 cycles. Results Assignment of patients to the fludarabineplus-chlorambucil group was stopped when a planned interim analysis revealed excessive toxicity and a response rate that was not better than the rate with fludarabine alone. Among the other two groups, the response rate was significantly higher for fludarabine alone than for chlorambucil alone. Among 170 patients treated with fludarabine, 20 percent had a complete remission, and 43 percent had a partial remission. The corresponding values for 181 patients treated with chlorambucil were 4 percent and 33 percent (P{\textless} 0.001 for both comparisons). The median duration of remission and the median progression-free survival in the fiudarabine group were 25 months and 20 months, respectively, whereas both values were 14 months in the chlorambucil group (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients treated with fludarabine was 66 months, which was not significantly different from the overall survival in the other two groups (56 months with chlorambucil and 55 months with combined treatment). Severe infections and neutropenia were more frequent with fludarabine than with chlorambucil (P=0.08), although, overall, toxic effects were tolerable with the two single-drug regimens. Conclusions. When used as the initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, fludarabine yields higher response rates and a longer duration of remission and progression-free survival than chlorambucil; overall survrval is not enhanced.

To evaluate the effects of this development, we identified all CLL patients registered in the nation-wide Danish Cancer Register between 1978 and 2013. We identified 10 455 CLL patients and 508 995 CLL-free control persons from the general population. Compared with the latter, the relative mortality rate between CLL patients and their controls decreased from 3.4 (95{\%} CI 3.2-3.6) to 1.9 (95{\%} CI 1.7-2.1) for patients diagnosed in 1978-1984 and 2006-2013, respectively. The improved survival corresponded to a decreasing risk of death from malignant hematological diseases, whereas the risk of death from infections was stable during the study period.

abstract = {Background: Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma relapse after initial therapy. Bendamustine plus rituximab is often used in the relapsed or refractory setting. We assessed the efficacy and safety of adding ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), to bendamustine plus rituximab in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Methods: The HELIOS trial was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in adult patients (≥18 years of age) who had active chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma with measurable lymph node disease ({\textgreater}1{\textperiodcentered}5 cm) by CT scan, and had relapsed or refractory disease following one or more previous lines of systemic therapy consisting of at least two cycles of a chemotherapy-containing regimen, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. Patients with del(17p) were excluded because of known poor response to bendamustine plus rituximab. Patients who had received previous treatment with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors, refractory disease or relapse within 24 months with a previous bendamustine-containing regimen, or haemopoietic stem-cell transplant were also excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based system to receive bendamustine plus rituximab given in cycles of 4 weeks' duration (bendamustine: 70 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2-3 in cycle 1, and days 1-2 in cycles 2-6; rituximab: 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycles 2-6 for a maximum of six cycles) with either ibrutinib (420 mg daily orally) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified according to whether they were refractory to purine analogues and by number of previous lines of therapy. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival. Crossover to ibrutinib was permitted for patients in the placebo group with IRC-confirmed disease progression. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and is continuing for further long-term follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01611090. Findings: Between Sept 19, 2012, and Jan 21, 2014, 578 eligible patients were randomly assigned to ibrutinib or placebo in combination with bendamustine plus rituximab (289 in each group). The primary endpoint was met at the preplanned interim analysis (March 10, 2015). At a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 13{\textperiodcentered}7-20{\textperiodcentered}7), progression-free survival was significantly improved in the ibrutinib group compared with the placebo group (not reached in the ibrutinib group (95{\%} CI not evaluable) vs 13{\textperiodcentered}3 months (11{\textperiodcentered}3-13{\textperiodcentered}9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}203, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}150-0{\textperiodcentered}276; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). IRC-assessed progression-free survival at 18 months was 79{\%} (95{\%} CI 73-83) in the ibrutinib group and 24{\%} (18-31) in the placebo group (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}203, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}150-0{\textperiodcentered}276; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The most frequent all-grade adverse events were neutropenia and nausea. 222 (77{\%}) of 287 patients in the ibrutinib group and 212 (74{\%}) of 287 patients in the placebo group reported grade 3-4 events; the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia (154 [54{\%}] in the ibrutinib group vs 145 [51{\%}] in the placebo group) and thrombocytopenia (43 [15{\%}] in each group). A safety profile similar to that previously reported with ibrutinib and bendamustine plus rituximab individually was noted. Interpretation: In patients eligible for bendamustine plus rituximab, the addition of ibrutinib to this regimen results in significant improvements in outcome with no new safety signals identified from the combination and a manageable safety profile.

This study assessed its efficacy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia pre-treated with an alkylator, in comparison to fludarabine. Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia requiring treatment after one previous systemic regimen (usually chlorambucil-based) were randomized to either receive bendamustine 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle or standard fludarabine treatment consisting of 25 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 5 every 4 weeks. The primary objective was to achieve non-inferior progression-free survival (PFS) with bendamustine. Out of a total of 96 patients randomized, 92 were eligible, 49 allocated to bendamustine and 43 to fludarabine. About half of the patients received six or more cycles. Overall response rates were 76 {\%} on bendamustine and 62 {\%} on fludarabine, with clinical complete response rates of 27 and 9 {\%}, respectively. Median PFS was 20.1 and 14.8 months (hazard ratio, 0.87; 90 {\%} confidence interval, 0.60-1.27), median overall survival 43.8 and 41.0 months (hazard ratio, 0.82). Thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicities were marginally more frequent on bendamustine, albeit CTC grade 3/4 event incidence was similar. These data suggest at least comparable efficacy of bendamustine vs. fludarabine, pointing to an alternative treatment option in relapsing CLL patients after chlorambucil containing initial chemotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable malignancy of mature B lymphocytes, involves blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes (LN). A role of the tissue microenvironment in the pathogenesis of CLL is hypothesized based on in vitro observations, but its contribution in vivo remains ill-defined. To elucidate the effects of tumor-host interactions in vivo, we purified tumor cells from 24 treatment-naive patients. Samples were obtained concurrently from blood, bone marrow, and/or LN and analyzed by gene expression profiling. We identified the LN as a key site in CLL pathogenesis. CLL cells in the LN showed up-regulation of gene signatures, indicating B-cell receptor (BCR) and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B activation. Consistent with antigen-dependent BCR signaling and canonical nuclear factor-$\kappa$B activation, we detected phosphorylation of SYK and I$\kappa$B$\alpha$, respectively. Expression of BCR target genes was stronger in clinically more aggressive CLL, indicating more effective BCR signaling in this subtype in vivo. Tumor proliferation, quantified by the expression of the E2F and c-MYC target genes and verified with Ki67 staining by flow cytometry, was highest in the LN and was correlated with clinical disease progression. These data identify the disruption of tumor microenvironment interactions and the inhibition of BCR signaling as promising therapeutic strategies in CLL.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, combined with chemotherapeutic agents, has been shown to prolong overall survival in physically fit patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but not in those with coexisting conditions. We investigated the benefit of the type 2, glycoengineered antibody obinutuzumab (also known as GA101) as compared with that of rituximab, each combined with chlorambucil, in patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting conditions. METHODS We randomly assigned 781 patients with previously untreated CLL and a score higher than 6 on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (range, 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating worse health status) or an estimated creatinine clearance of 30 to 69 ml per minute to receive chlorambucil, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil, or rituximab plus chlorambucil. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. RESULTS The patients had a median age of 73 years, creatinine clearance of 62 ml per minute, and CIRS score of 8 at baseline. Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil or rituximab-chlorambucil, as compared with chlorambucil monotherapy, increased response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (median progression-free survival, 26.7 months with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil vs. 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.18; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.13 to 0.24; P{\textless}0.001; and 16.3 months with rituximab-chlorambucil vs. 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; hazard ratio, 0.44; 95{\%} CI, 0.34 to 0.57; P{\textless}0.001). Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, as compared with chlorambucil alone, prolonged overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95{\%} CI, 0.23 to 0.74; P=0.002). Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, as compared with rituximab-chlorambucil, resulted in prolongation of progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95{\%} CI, 0.31 to 0.49; P{\textless}0.001) and higher rates of complete response (20.7{\%} vs. 7.0{\%}) and molecular response. Infusion-related reactions and neutropenia were more common with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil than with rituximab-chlorambucil, but the risk of infection was not increased. CONCLUSIONS Combining an anti-CD20 antibody with chemotherapy improved outcomes in patients with CLL and coexisting conditions. In this patient population, obinutuzumab was superior to rituximab when each was combined with chlorambucil. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01010061.).},

Leukemia cells from identical twins with CLL were found discordant for expression of ZAP-70, suggesting that B-cell expression of ZAP-70 is not genetically predetermined. Ligation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex on CLL cells that expressed ZAP-70 induced significantly greater tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins, including p72Syk, than did similar stimulation of CLL cells that did not express ZAP-70. Also, exceptional cases of CLL cells that expressed mutated immunoglobulin V genes and ZAP-70 also experienced higher levels tyrosine phosphorylation of such cytosolic proteins following BCR ligation. Following BCR ligation, ZAP-70 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation and became associated with surface immunoglobulin and CD79b, arguing for the involvement of ZAP-70 in BCR signaling. These data indicate that expression of ZAP-70 is associated with enhanced signal transduction via the BCR complex, which may contribute to the more aggressive clinical course associated with CLL cells that express nonmutated immunoglobulin receptors. {\textcopyright} 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Patients were treated at 6 dose levels of oral idelalisib (range 50-350 mg once or twice daily) and remained on continuous therapy while deriving clinical benefit. Idelalisib-mediated inhibition of PI3Kd led to abrogation of Akt phosphorylation in patient CLL cells and significantly reduced serum levels of CLL-related chemokines. The most commonly observed grade ≥3 adverse events were pneumonia (20{\%}), neutropenic fever (11{\%}), and diarrhea (6{\%}). Idelalisib treatment resulted in nodal responses in 81{\%} of patients. The overall response rate was 72{\%}, with 39{\%} of patients meeting the criteria for partial response per IWCLL 2008 and 33{\%} meeting the recently updated criteria of PR with treatment-induced lymphocytosis.1,2 The median progression-free survival for all patients was 15.8 months.

abstract = {In addition to clinical staging, a number of biomarkers predicting overall survival (OS) have been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The multiplicity of markers, limited information on their independent prognostic value, and a lack of understanding of how to interpret discordant markers are major barriers to use in routine clinical practice. We therefore performed an analysis of 23 prognostic markers based on prospectively collected data from 1948 CLL patients participating in phase 3 trials of the German CLL Study Group to develop a comprehensive prognostic index. A multi variable Cox regression model identified 8 independent predictors of OS: sex, age, ECOG status, del(17p), del(11q), IGHV mutation status, serum b2-microglobulin, and serum thymidine kinase. Using a weighted grading system, a prognostic index was derived that separated 4 risk categories with 5-year OS ranging from 18.7{\%} to 95.2{\%} and having a C-statistic of 0.75. The index stratified OS within all analyzed subgroups, including all Rai/Binet stages. The validity of the index was externally confirmed in a series of 676 newly diagnosed CLL patients from Mayo Clinic. Using this multistep process including external validation, we developed a comprehensive prognostic index with high discriminatory power and prognostic significance on the individual patient level. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Introduction: PI3K$\delta$ signaling is critical for the proliferation, survival and homing/tissue retention of malignant B cells. Idelalisib is a first-in-class, highly selective, oral inhibitor of PI3K$\delta$ recently approved for the treatment of relapsed CLL in combination with R. This report summarizes the long-term follow-up of the Phase 1 combination experience of idelalisib with anti-CD20 antibodies.Methods: This Phase 1 study evaluated idelalisib for relapsed/refractory CLL continuously given at 100 mg BID (4 of the pts receiving R) or 150 mg BID (all other pts) in combination with a total of 8 infusions of rituximab (R, 375 mg/m2 weekly x 8), or a total of 12 infusions of ofatumumab (O, 300mg initial dose either on Day 1 or Day 2 relative to the first dose of idelalisib, then 1,000 mg weekly x 7, then 1,000 mg every 4 wks x 4). Pts on treatment after 48 weeks were eligible to continue idelalisib on an extension study. Clinical response was evaluated according to published criteria (Hallek 2008; Cheson 2012).Results: 40 pts (12F/28M) with a median (range) age of 66 (43-87) years and a WHO performance status of 0 (24, 60{\%}) or 1 (16, 40{\%}) were enrolled. 19 pts received idelalisib in combination with R and 21 with O.Adverse disease characteristics (n, {\%}) included Rai Stage III/IV (20, 50{\%}), bulky lymphadenopathy (23, 58{\%}), refractory disease (15, 38{\%}), multiple prior therapies (median 2, range: 1-9). Almost all pts (39, 98{\%}) had at least 1 prior therapy containing R, and 3 of the 21 pts (14{\%}) receiving idelalisib + O had received prior O. 63{\%} of the pts receiving idelalisib + R, and 48{\%} of the pts receiving idelalisib + O were refractory to R. Prior therapies also included alkylating agents (31, 78{\%}, [bendamustine: 20, 50{\%}]) and purine analogs (31, 78{\%}, [fludarabine: 28, 70{\%}]). Data available from 39 pts showed that 11 (28{\%}) pts had evidence of del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations and 30 (75{\%}) had unmutated IGHV.As of 7/15/2014, the median (range) treatment duration was 18 (0-44) months. 23 (58{\%}) pts have completed the primary study and enrolled into the extension study. Primary reasons for study discontinuation (as reported by investigators) included disease progression (14, 35{\%}), adverse events (AEs) (12, 30{\%}), investigator request (3, 8{\%}), withdrawal of consent (n=1), BMT (n=1). There were a total of 8 deaths on study: 2 deaths occurred after disease progression, and 6 pts died because of AEs (all assessed as unrelated/unlikely related to idelalisib by investigators). A total of 4 pts (10{\%}) were continuing idelalisib treatment on the extension study at time of analysis.Selected treatment-emergent AEs (any Grade/≥Gr 3, regardless of causality) included diarrhea/colitis (55{\%}/23{\%}), cough (40{\%}/3{\%}), pyrexia (40{\%}/3{\%}), dyspnea (30{\%}/3{\%}), fatigue (25{\%}/0{\%}) nausea (25{\%}/0{\%}), rash (20{\%}/0{\%}), pneumonia (20{\%}/18{\%}), and pneumonitis (8{\%}/5{\%}). Elevation of liver transaminases (TA, any Grade/≥Gr 3) was seen in 30{\%}/10{\%}. Re-exposure to idelalisib after resolution of TA elevation generally was successful; only 1 patient discontinued the study because of (recurrent) TA elevation. Other AEs leading to study discontinuation and reported as possibly/probably related to idelalisib included diarrhea/colitis (4, 10{\%}), pyrexia (n=1), interstitial lung disease (n=1), pneumonia (n=1), rash (n=1), psoriasis (n=1). Secondary malignancies leading to discontinuation (all reported as unrelated) were breast cancer (n=1), recurrent colon cancer (n=1), AML (n=1). There was no obvious overall difference in the toxicity reported for pts receiving idelalisib with rituximab compared to those with ofatumumab.The ORR (N=40) was 83{\%} (33/40), with 2 CRs (5{\%}) reported. Median PFS (N=40) and duration of response (DOR) (n=33) were 24 months. Median (range) time to response was 1.9 (range 1.7-16.9) months. Median overall survival (OS) has not been reached with a KM estimate for OS of 80{\%} at 24 months. For the 11 pts with del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations, the response rate was 73{\%}, and the median PFS and DOR were 20 and 24 months, respectively.Conclusions: Combinations of idelalisib with anti-CD20 antibodies such as R or O represent non-cytotoxic regimens with acceptable safety profiles and considerable activity resulting in durable tumor control in pts with relapsed/refractory CLL, including those with high risk factors such as del(17p) or TP53 mutations. A Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy of idelalisib in combination with ofatumumab is ongoing (NCT01659021).},

FC treatment also resulted in longer median progression-free survival (48 vs 20 months; P = .001) and longer treatment-free survival (37 vs 25 months; P {\textless} .001). Thus far, no difference in median overall survival has been observed. FC caused significantly more thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia but did not increase the number of severe infections.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a common and clinically heterogeneous leukemia occurring in adults, remains poorly understood.

METHODS:We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease.

RESULTS:Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15{\%} of patients, ATM in 9{\%}, MYD88 in 10{\%}, and NOTCH1 in 4{\%}) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15{\%} of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.

CONCLUSIONS:Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have clinically significant coexisting medical conditions are less able to undergo standard chemotherapy. Effective therapies with acceptable side-effect profiles are needed for this patient population. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of idelalisib, an oral inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. We randomly assigned 220 patients with decreased renal function, previous therapy-induced myelosuppression, or major coexisting illnesses to receive rituximab and either idelalisib (at a dose of 150 mg) or placebo twice daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. At the first prespecified interim analysis, the study was stopped early on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board owing to overwhelming efficacy. RESULTS The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the placebo group and was not reached in the idelalisib group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the idelalisib group, 0.15; P{\textless}0.001). Patients receiving idelalisib versus those receiving placebo had improved rates of overall response (81{\%} vs. 13{\%}; odds ratio, 29.92; P{\textless}0.001) and overall survival at 12 months (92{\%} vs. 80{\%}; hazard ratio for death, 0.28; P=0.02). Serious adverse events occurred in 40{\%} of the patients receiving idelalisib and rituximab and in 35{\%} of those receiving placebo and rituximab. CONCLUSIONS The combination of idelalisib and rituximab, as compared with placebo and rituximab, significantly improved progression-free survival, response rate, and overall survival among patients with relapsed CLL who were less able to undergo chemotherapy.

abstract = {Background: Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma relapse after initial therapy. Bendamustine plus rituximab is often used in the relapsed or refractory setting. We assessed the efficacy and safety of adding ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), to bendamustine plus rituximab in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Methods: The HELIOS trial was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in adult patients (≥18 years of age) who had active chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma with measurable lymph node disease ({\textgreater}1{\textperiodcentered}5 cm) by CT scan, and had relapsed or refractory disease following one or more previous lines of systemic therapy consisting of at least two cycles of a chemotherapy-containing regimen, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. Patients with del(17p) were excluded because of known poor response to bendamustine plus rituximab. Patients who had received previous treatment with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors, refractory disease or relapse within 24 months with a previous bendamustine-containing regimen, or haemopoietic stem-cell transplant were also excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based system to receive bendamustine plus rituximab given in cycles of 4 weeks' duration (bendamustine: 70 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2-3 in cycle 1, and days 1-2 in cycles 2-6; rituximab: 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycles 2-6 for a maximum of six cycles) with either ibrutinib (420 mg daily orally) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified according to whether they were refractory to purine analogues and by number of previous lines of therapy. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival. Crossover to ibrutinib was permitted for patients in the placebo group with IRC-confirmed disease progression. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and is continuing for further long-term follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01611090. Findings: Between Sept 19, 2012, and Jan 21, 2014, 578 eligible patients were randomly assigned to ibrutinib or placebo in combination with bendamustine plus rituximab (289 in each group). The primary endpoint was met at the preplanned interim analysis (March 10, 2015). At a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 13{\textperiodcentered}7-20{\textperiodcentered}7), progression-free survival was significantly improved in the ibrutinib group compared with the placebo group (not reached in the ibrutinib group (95{\%} CI not evaluable) vs 13{\textperiodcentered}3 months (11{\textperiodcentered}3-13{\textperiodcentered}9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}203, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}150-0{\textperiodcentered}276; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). IRC-assessed progression-free survival at 18 months was 79{\%} (95{\%} CI 73-83) in the ibrutinib group and 24{\%} (18-31) in the placebo group (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}203, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}150-0{\textperiodcentered}276; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). The most frequent all-grade adverse events were neutropenia and nausea. 222 (77{\%}) of 287 patients in the ibrutinib group and 212 (74{\%}) of 287 patients in the placebo group reported grade 3-4 events; the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia (154 [54{\%}] in the ibrutinib group vs 145 [51{\%}] in the placebo group) and thrombocytopenia (43 [15{\%}] in each group). A safety profile similar to that previously reported with ibrutinib and bendamustine plus rituximab individually was noted. Interpretation: In patients eligible for bendamustine plus rituximab, the addition of ibrutinib to this regimen results in significant improvements in outcome with no new safety signals identified from the combination and a manageable safety profile.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progressionfree survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88{\%} at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P{\textless}0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P = 0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90{\%} in the ibrutinib group and 81{\%} in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6{\%} vs. 4.1{\%}, P{\textless}0.001). An additional 20{\%} of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.

abstract = {Increasing recognition of the importance of vein graft stenoses in precipitating failure of femorodistal bypass procedures has stimulated an increasing interest in noninvasive postoperative surveillance. We have used duplex scanning, measuring relative changes in velocity throughout the entire length of the graft, to detect nonhemodynamic stenoses (i.e., stenoses without a significant change in ankle-brachial pressure indexes) as well as more severe lesions during the postoperative period. Seventy-five in situ vein grafts were assessed at three monthly intervals from operation with duplex scanning and intravenous digital subtraction angiography. Nineteen grafts (25{\%}) had angiographically documented stenoses at a mean follow-up of 12 months. All 19 stenoses were detected independently by duplex velocity ratio criteria and 15 were correctly graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The results suggest that duplex-derived velocity ratio criteria are appropriate for graft surveillance and for determining the natural history of even minor stenoses to identify the optimal time of surgical intervention. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@article{Braaten1994,
abstract = {Objective: Several studies have indicated that consumption of oat bran lowers blood cholesterol and this effect has been attributed specifically to oat bran's soluble fiber ($\beta$-glucan). This study was designed to test this hypothesis. Design: The purified fibre (oat gum, 80{\%} $\beta$-glucan) was isolated, and agglomerated in the presence of maltodextrin to facilitate dispersion in a drink. Subjects consumed the oat gum (2.9 g $\beta$-glucan), or maltodextrin placebo, twice daily for 4 weeks, in a randomized, cross-over design with a 3 week wash-out between phases. Consumption was equivalent to a daily dose of about 70 g of oat bran. Setting: The study was with free-living individuals. Subjects: Twenty hypercholesterolemic male and female adults entered, and 19 completed, the study. Interventions: Blood lipids from fasting individuals were measured weekly throughout the study. Diet was monitored using 3 day food diaries. Results: There were no significant changes (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in blood lipids during the placebo phase. Mean initial total cholesterol (6.76 ± 0.13 mmol/l) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (4.59 ± 0.14 mmol/l) levels fell throughout the oat gum phase, and at week 4 each was reduced 9{\%} relative to initial values (P = 0.0004 and 0.005 respectively). When oat gum was discontinued, total and LDL cholesterol returned to initial levels. There were no significant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Triglyceride levels also remained unchanged except for a singular decrease at week 4 of the oat gum phase relative to the initial value, but not compared to the placebo value. The lowered mean total and LDL cholesterol levels occurred in the absence of any dietary changes. Conclusions: The main component of the soluble fibre of oats, $\beta$-glucan, significantly reduced the total and LDL cholesterol levels of hypercholesterolemic adults without changing HDL cholesterol.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE - To investigate in a population of Hispanic children if 1) the presence of acanthosis nigricans (AN) is related to insulin sensitivity (S i) independent of adiposity and 2) scale scoring AN severity adds to the clinical estimation of insulin sensitivity, above and beyond the presence or absence AN alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The study population, 131 Hispanic overweight children (mean BMI percentile 97.0 ± 3.1, 72 boys, 59 girls, ages 8-13 years, mean Tanner stage 2.4 ± 1.5) with a family history of type 2 diabetes, underwent a physical examination of the neck to determine AN absence or presence (0-1), AN extent score (0-4 scale), AN texture score (0-3 scale), and an AN combined score (extent + texture; 0-7 scale). Si was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal modeling. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine the role of BMI and AN in predicting Si. RESULTS - BMI was the main predictor of Si, explaining ∼41{\%} of the variance. The presence of AN explained an additional 4{\%} of the variability in Si; scale scoring of AN extent or texture did not significantly improve the prediction. CONCLUSIONS - Although AN is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance in overweight Hispanic children at risk for type 2 diabetes, body adiposity is the primary determinant of insulin sensitivity. In addition, scale scoring AN seems of minimal usefulness in clinically estimating the severity of insulin resistance over and above assessing the presence or absence of AN and calculating BMI.},

abstract = {Background and aim of the study: Our own studies confirm the hypothesis, that insulin resistance of various degree is often observed in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The knowledge of this parameter characterizing individual patients may be of great value not only for better understanding of the disease course but also as a potential source of specific treatment. Reliable estimation of insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is a complex, laborious and costly procedure. These facts were enough to motivate us to make an attempt to elaborate an indirect, simplified method of insulin resistance assessment in T1DM children, that would be based on patients characteristics and on clinical parameters of the disease course. Materials and methods: 142 children and adolescents with T1DM (79 boys, 63 girls) aged 7.7-20.3 years (mean age - 13.7±3.3 years) were included into the study. Duration of diabetes was 0.5-12.5 years (mean 2.7±2.3 years). The stage of puberty was assessed by the Tanner scale. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp by de Fronzo was performed to estimate insulin resistance. Glucose disposal rate (M index) determined during the last 30 min of the test estimated insulin resistance. Looking for clinical and metabolic factors characterizing insulin resistance: a) the plasma cholesterol, HDL-Ch, tryglicerides and HbA1c were examined, b) the height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured, c) body mass index and daily dose of insulin were calculated. For statistical analysis the multiple regression was used (forward stepwise method). Results: In the study group M index ranged from 2.1 to 17.4 mg/kg/min (mean 7.27±2.62 mg/kg/min). The boys presented better insulin sensitivity than girls (7.79 vs. 6.62, p=0.008). The insulin resistance depended on the patients' age (r=-0.46, p{\textless}0.001) and stage of puberty (p{\textless}0.001). A correlation between M index and insulin dose (r=-0.34, p{\textless}0.05) and HbA1C (r=-0.17; p=0.04) were found. There was a significant relationship between M index and parameters of adiposity, lipids and blood pressure. All significant clinical parameters of insulin resistance were subjected to the analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed. The model with the strongest correlation with index M was used to work out the formula: M index = 17.065 + 1.547 × (gender: boys=1, girls=0) - 0,183 × (age) - 0,117 × (Waist circumference) - 2,019 × (Daily insulin dose) - 0,016 × (LDL-CH) + 0,041 × (DBP). Conclusion: In T1DM children and adolescents it is possible to estimate for daily use extent of insulin resistance on the basis of clinical features. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 Cornetis.},

abstract = {Background: This study evaluated the effect of vildagliptin + metformin on glycemic control and $\beta$-cell function in type 2 diabetes patients. Subjects and Methods: One hundred seventy-one type 2 diabetes patients, naive to antidiabetes therapy and with poor glycemic control, were instructed to take metformin for 8±2 months up to a mean dosage of 2,500±500 mg/day; then they were randomly assigned to add vildaglipin 50 mg twice a day or placebo for 12 months. We evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months: body mass index, glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment $\beta$-cell function index (HOMA-$\beta$), fasting plasma proinsulin, proinsulin/fasting plasma insulin ratio, C-peptide, glucagon, adiponectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Before and at 12 months after the addition of vildagliptin, patients underwent a combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp, with subsequent arginine stimulation, to assess insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Results: After 12 months of treatment, vildagliptin + metformin gave a better decrease of body weight, glycemic control, HOMA-IR, and glucagon and a better increase of HOMA-$\beta$ compared with placebo+metformin. Regarding the measures of $\beta$-cell function, treatment-induced changes in M-value, first- and second-phase C-peptide response to glucose, and C-peptide response to arginine were significantly higher in the vildagliptin+metformin group compared with the placebo + metformin group. Conclusion: The addition of vildagliptin to metformin gave a better improvement of glycemic control, insulin resistance, and $\beta$-cell function compared with metformin alone. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE - To compare $\beta$-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, disposition index (DI), calculated from two clamps (2cDI, insulin sensitivity from the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and first-phase insulin from the hyperglycemic clamp) with the DI calculated from the hyperglycemic clamp alone (hcDI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Complete data from hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were available for 330 youth: 73 normal weight, 168 obese with normal glucose tolerance, 57 obese with impaired glucose tolerance, and 32 obese with type 2 diabetes. The correlation between hcDI and 2cDI and Bland-Altman analysis of agreement between the two were examined. RESULTS - Insulin sensitivity and first-phase insulin fromhcDI showed a hyperbolic relationship. The hcDI correlated significantly with 2cDI in the groups combined (r = 0.85, P {\textless} 0.001) and within each group separately ( r ≥ 62, P {\textless} 0.001). Similar to 2cDI, hcDI showed a declining pattern of $\beta$-cell function across the glucose-tolerance groups. Overall, hcDI values were 27{\%} greater than 2cDI, due to the hyperglycemic versus euglycemic conditions, reflected in a positive bias with Bland-Altman analysis. CONCLUSIONS - $\beta$-Cell function relative to insulin sensitivity could be accurately evaluated from a single hyperglycemic clamp, obviating the need for two separate clamp experiments, when lessening participant burden and reducing research costs are important considerations. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract = {Context: Insulin resistance precedes metabolic syndrome abnormalities and may promote cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in children with obesity. Results of lifestyle modification programs have been discouraging, and the use of adjuvant strategies has been necessary. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of metformin and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on insulin sensitivity, measured via euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique and insulin pathway expression molecules in muscle biopsies of children with obesity. Design: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted. Setting: Children with obesity were randomly assigned to receive metformin, CLA, or placebo. Results: Intervention had a positive effect in all groups. For insulin sensitivity Rd value (mg/kg/min), there was a statistically significant difference between the CLA vs placebo (6.5362.54 vs 5.0561.46, P = 0.035). Insulinemia and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance significantly improved in the CLA group (P = 0.045). After analysis of covariance was performed and the influence of body mass index, age, Tanner stage, prescribed diet, and fitness achievement was controlled, a clinically relevant effect size on insulin sensitivity remained evident in the CLA group (37{\%}) and exceeded lifestyle program benefits. Moreover, upregulated expression of the insulin receptor substrate 2 was evident in muscle biopsies of the CLA group. Conclusions: Improvement of insulin sensitivity,measured via euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and IRS2 upregulation, favored patients treated with CLA.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between intrauterine growth retardation and an increased risk of adult diseases that include essential hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease. A common feature of these diseases is insulin resistance. To investigate whether abnormal insulin sensitivity was a characteristic of subjects with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), we compared two groups of short prepubertal children: a group with IUGR (birth weight less than the tenth percentile; n = 15) and a normal birth weight group (n = 12). Subjects underwent a modified frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test that permitted calculation of the acute insulin response, insulin sensitivity index, and glucose effectiveness. A marked difference in the insulin sensitivity index was noted between groups, with the IUGR group being less insulin sensitive 16.9 vs. 16.9 10-4 min-1 {\textperiodcentered} ($\mu$U/mL);P = 0.0048]. The acute insulin response was also significantly different between groups, with IUGR subjects having higher insulin levels (445 vs. 174 $\mu$U/mL; P = 0.005). There was no difference in glucose effectiveness between groups. Short prepubertal IUGR children have a specific impairment in insulin sensitivity compared to their normal birth weight peers. In short IUGR children, impaired insulin sensitivity is a potential marker for the early identification and intervention in the development of late adult-onset noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.},

@article{Henderson2011,
abstract = {Aim: The objective of the study was to examine the correlation between three methods of measuring insulin sensitivity (IS) - namely, the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), indices derived from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting indices (HOMA-IR, QUICKI, fasting insulin [INS0]) - and the gold-standard method, the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (HEC) test, in children. Methods: A total of 20 children [nine boys and 11 girls; mean (SD) age: 9 (2) years] were studied. Their mean (SD) BMI Z score was 1.5 (0.8). All participants had normal glucose metabolism. Each child underwent a 3-h HEC (40 mU/m2/min of insulin), an insulin-modified minimal-model FSIVGTT and a 3-h OGTT. The clamp-derived IS was calculated, using DeFronzo's metabolized glucose index and Bergman's IS index. Correlations were established using Spearman's rank correlations. Results: The two clamp-derived measures were highly correlated (r=0.85), and the IS measured from the FSIVGTT was well correlated with both clamp measures [r=0.69, 0.74]. Of the nine indices derived from the OGTT, the three with the highest correlation with clamp results were the ISI Matsuda [r=0.63, 0.68], SIisOGTT [r=0.53, 0.65] and log sum insulin [r=-0.64, -0.75]. Fasting indices of IS had similar correlations to clamp results: HOMA-IR [r=-0.55, -0.56]; QUICKI [r=0.55, 0.57]; and INS0 [r=-0.59, -0.63]. Conclusion: While fasting-based indices of IS are a suitable option for large cohorts, OGTT-derived indices may represent a useful compromise for obtaining both clinical (glucose tolerance) and physiological (insulin sensitivity) information, making them particularly useful for large-scale physiological and epidemiological studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

@article{Dabelea2012,
abstract = {Aims/hypothesis Few studies have explored the epidemiology of beta cell loss in youth with diabetes. This report describes the evolution and major determinants of beta cell function, assessed by fasting C-peptide (FCP), in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study. Methods Participants were 1,277 youth with diabetes (948 positive for diabetes autoantibodies [DAs] and 329 negative for DAs), diagnosed when aged {\textless}20 years, who were followed from a median of 8 months post diagnosis, for approximately 30 months. We modelled the relationship between rate of change in log FCP and determinants of interest using repeated measures general linear models. Results Among DA-positive youth, there was a progressive decline in beta cell function of 4{\%} per month,independent of demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity (HLA risk), HbA1c and BMI z score, or presence of insulin resistance. Among DA-negative youth, there was marked heterogeneity in beta cell loss, reflecting an aet ologically mixed group. This group likely includes youths with undetected autoimmunity (whose decline is similar to that of DA-positive youth) and youth with non-autoimmune, insulin-resistant diabetes, with limited decline (̃0.7{\%} per month). Conclusions/interpretation SEARCH provides unique estimates of beta cell function decline in a large sample of youth with diabetes, indicating that autoimmunity is the major contributor. These data contribute to a better understanding of clinical evolution of beta cell function in youth with diabetes, provide strong support for the aetiological classification of diabetes type and may inform tertiary prevention efforts targeted at high-risk groups. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate in prepubertal children whether physical fitness and/or physical activity are: 1) associated with insulin secretion and sensitivity and 2) account for racial differences in insulin secretion and sensitivity. Research Methods and Procedures: Subjects included 34 African American and 34 white nondiabetic children aged 5 to 11 years. Data were divided into two sets according to the availability of VO2max and physical activity data. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and intra-abdominal adipose tissue were examined by computed tomography. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and acute insulin response (AIR) were determined by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. An all-out, progressive treadmill exercise test was used for measuring VO2max. Physical activity data were collected by questionnaire. Results: African American children had lower SI and higher AIR than white children, after adjusting for total body fat mass. African Americans reported higher levels of physical activity (hours/wk) than whites, but had a lower VO2max. In multiple linear regression analysis, hours/wk of activity and hours/wk of vigorous activity, but not moderate activity, were independently related to SI and AIR after adjusting for race, total body fat mass or fat distribution, and total lean tissue mass. VO2max was not related to AIR, and was inversely related to SI, after adjusting for body composition. Race remained significantly associated with both SI and AIR, even after adjusting for body composition, fat distribution, and hours/wk of activity or hours/wk of vigorous activity. Discussion: In summary, overall physical activity and, especially, vigorous activity were associated with insulin secretion and sensitivity. However, neither physical activity nor VO2max explained the racial difference in insulin secretion (higher in African Americans) and sensitivity (lower in African Americans). Thus, racial (African American to white) differences in aspects of insulin action seem to be due to factors other than body composition, fat distribution, cardiovascular fitness, and amount of physical activity.},

abstract = {The simultaneous assessment of insulin action, secretion, and hepatic extraction is key to understanding postprandial glucose metabolism in nondiabetic and diabetic humans. We review the oral minimal method (i.e., models that allow the estimation of insulin sensitivity, $\beta$-cell responsivity, and hepatic insulin extraction from a mixed-meal or an oral glucose tolerance test). Both of these oral tests are more physiologic and simpler to administer than those based on an intravenous test (e.g., a glucose clamp or an intravenous glucose tolerance test). The focus of this review is on indices provided by physiological-based models and their validation against the glucose clamp technique. We discuss first the oral minimal model method rationale, data, and protocols. Then we present the three minimal models and the indices they provide. The disposition index paradigm, a widely used $\beta$-cell function metric, is revisited in the context of individual versus population modeling. Adding a glucose tracer to the oral dose significantly enhances the assessment of insulin action by segregating insulin sensitivity into its glucose disposal and hepatic components. The oral minimal model method, by quantitatively portraying the complex relationships between the major players of glucose metabolism, is able to provide novel insights regarding the regulation of postprandial metabolism. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract = {Background: We aimed to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children, adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and to assess the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its components. Methods: The study cohort comprised 326 (168 women) consecutive patients aged 5 to 30 years diagnosed with T1DM and followed up in the Juvenile Diabetes Clinic, Maccabi Health Care Services. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, presence of additional diseases, other medications, HbA1c, triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were obtained. Results: The mean age in the study group was 18.5±6.0 years, and the mean diabetes duration was 8.7±5.0 years. Mean HbA1c level was 8.1±1.3{\%}. Nineteen per cent of the study population was overweight (85th{\textgreater}body mass index{\textless}95th percentile) and 5.2{\%} was obese (body mass index≥95th percentile). Female patients aged 15≤18 and 18≤25 years were significantly overweight compared with healthy Israeli women in the same age groups, 33.3{\%} versus 12.7{\%} and 26.3{\%} versus 7.8{\%}, respectively, p{\textless}0001. There were no obese female patients in the 15≤18 age group. Among the men in all age groups, there was no difference in the prevalence of overweight and obesity compared with healthy men in the general population. There was no difference in the age of onset, disease duration, HbA1c levels, treatment with anti-depressants and associated morbidities between the normal weight, overweight and obese groups. Obese patients had lower levels of HDL and increased prevalence of hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: Overweight but not obesity was more prevalent in women with T1DM. Metabolic syndrome and its components were more prevalent among overweight and obese individuals with T1DM than among normal weight individuals.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: The ability to measure insulin sensitivity across the phenotypic spectrum of diabetes may contribute to a more accurate characterisation of diabetes type. Our goal was to develop and validate an insulin sensitivity (IS) score using the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp in a subset (n=85) of 12- to 19-year-old youths with diabetes participating in the SEARCH study in Colorado, USA. Methods: Youths with a diagnosis of type 1 (n=60) or type 2 diabetes (n=25) underwent a 3 h clamp to measure glucose disposal rate (GDR, mg kg-1 min-1). Demographic (age, sex, race), clinical (BMI, waist, Tanner stage) and metabolic characteristics (HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure, urine albumin:creatinine) were used to estimate log eIS score via stepwise linear regression on a modeldevelopment set (n=53). Estimated IS score was evaluated for reproducibility on two validation sets: youths with diabetes (n=33) and healthy control youths (n=22). Results: The best model included waist, triacylglycerol (TG) and HbA1c levels (R2=0.74). Diabetes type did not enter the model and there were no significant interactions between diabetes type and other predictors. Estimated IS score correlated well (r=0.65, p{\textless}0.0001; r=0.62, p=0.002) with GDR on the two validation sets. Based on this analysis, we propose the following formula to estimate insulin sensitivity in youths with diabetes: logeIS = 4:64725 - 0:02032 (waist; cm) - 0:09779 (HbA1c; {\%}) - 0:00235 (TG; mg=dl; to convert TG values from mmol=l to mg=dl; divide by 0:0113). Conclusions/ interpretation: Insulin sensitivity can be estimated in adolescents with diabetes using routinely collected measures. This score can be applied to epidemiological studies of youths with diabetes to characterise relationships between dimensions of diabetes type. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {Aims Decreased insulin sensitivity is a cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF) in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Whether baseline insulin sensitivity is independently associated with changes in early arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity (PWV)) over time in youth with T1D is not known. Methods Two hundred ninety-eight youth with T1D in the SEARCH CVD study had PWV measured {\~{}} five years apart. Insulin sensitivity and other CVRFs were measured at baseline. The association between baseline insulin sensitivity with PWV over time was explored using linear mixed models. Models were adjusted for baseline age, sex and race, with subsequent adjustment for CVRFs. Results There was a significant interaction (p = 0.0326) between baseline insulin sensitivity and time on PWV, independent of CVRFs, indicating that higher insulin sensitivity levels were associated with lower rate of change in PWV over time. Other significant predictors of PWV change were baseline age [$\beta$ = 0.007 (p = 0.03) increase in logPWV/year increase in age] and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) [$\beta$ = 0.005 (p {\textless} 0.01) increase in logPWV/mmHg increase in MAP] and smoking status (current vs. never smoker). Conclusions Lower insulin sensitivity at baseline appears to be an important risk factor for increased arterial stiffness over time in youth with T1D. This identifies a potentially modifiable therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Aim: To estimate insulin sensitivity in Type 1 diabetic children and adolescents, and assess the relationship between insulin sensitivity and clinical markers of adiposity and parameters of the metabolic syndrome. Methods: A total of 202 patients aged 8-18 years with Type 1 diabetes and disease duration 1.5-15 years participated. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by glucose uptake during an euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp and was calculated as the average amount of glucose (Mlbm = mg/kglbm/min) required to maintain euglycaemia. Blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid concentrations were measured. Results: The Mlbm value ranged from 4.14 to 25.25 mg/kglbm/min (mean 9.81 ± 3.34 mg/kglbm/min). There was a significant relationship between M value and patients' age (r = -0.38, P {\textless} 0.0001). Insulin sensitivity decreased significantly with the onset of puberty; hence, it was significantly lower in pubertal and post-pubertal adolescents. Girls were significantly more insulin resistant than boys (9.01 ± 0.32 vs. 10.43 ± 0.29 mg/kg lbm/min, P = 0.005). Insulin sensitivity correlated with body mass index (r = -0.29, P {\textless} 0.001), waist circumference (r = -0.35, P {\textless} 0.001), triceps skin fold (r = -0.17, P = 0.018), subscapular skin fold (r = -0.23, P = 0.001) and body fat (r = -0.19, P = 0.006). There was a relationship between Mlbm value, cholesterol (r = -0.18, P = 0.012), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.15, P = 0.035), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.22, P = 0.002), triglycerides (r = -0.32, P {\textless} 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (r = -0.15, P = 0.029). Insulin resistance was related to HbA1c (r = -0.18, P = 0.012). Additionally, there was a correlation between Mlbm value and insulin dose. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus have a very wide range of insulin sensitivity, which is determined by sex, age, amount of adipose tissue and glycaemic control. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {The aim of the present work was to study the association between different anthropometric parameters and insulin resistance (IR) in Spanish schoolchildren without a previous diagnosis. A total of 443 Spanish schoolchildren (9-11 years of age) were studied in this cross-sectional study. The anthropometric measurements collected were weight, height, body circumferences and skinfolds. Body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio, percentage body fat and fat-free body mass were determined. Overnight-fasted blood lipids, insulin and glucose levels were analysed, and estimation of IR, taking into account the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), was calculated. The children with IR had higher serum triglycerides and insulin levels, were heavier and taller, and had a higher BMI, a larger waist circumference, a larger hip circumference, a larger waist/hip ratio and thicker bicipital and tricipital skinfolds than those who did not have IR. Age, sex, BMI and waist circumference explained 32.0{\%} of the variance in the HOMA values; only sex, triglycerides and waist circumference independently influenced this variable. A 1-cm increase in waist circumference was associated with approximately a 3.8{\%} increase in the mean HOMA value. The children with a waist circumference of over the p90 for their age and sex were at greater risk of showing IR as measured by the HOMA: odds ratio = 6.94 (2.01-23.91; P {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, according to these results, waist circumference is the best anthropometric parameter associated with IR in children, and those with a waist circumference of over the p90 for their age and sex would appear to be at particular risk. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background: Children with type 1 diabetes demonstrate worse cognitive performance compared with their peers. Little is known regarding the cognitive and behavioral performance in obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Cross sectional evaluation of 20 obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy adolescents was performed in Cincinnati, Ohio. Cognitive tests that included measures of processing speed, working memory, verbal and semantic fluency and parent reports of executive function and problem behavior were compared. Academic achievement and the relationship between cognitive/behavioral scores and diabetes duration and diabetes control (hemoglobin A1c) were assessed in the type 2 diabetes group only. Results: The type 2 diabetes group had mean duration of diabetes of 2.8 ± 2.2 yr and hemoglobin A1c of 7.9 ± 2.2{\%}. Adolescents with type 2 diabetes scored lower than controls on tests of working and verbal memory and processing speed (all p {\textless} 0.05) and worse for Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist (all p {\textless} 0.05). Adolescents with type 2 diabetes scored below the population mean in academic achievement, most notably calculation. Working memory and processing speed were negatively correlated with duration of diabetes (r = −0.50 and −0.47, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: Obese youth with type 2 diabetes score poorly compared with controls on multiple assessments of cognitive function and adaptive behavior. Further work is needed to determine if these effects are driven by obesity, diabetes or other demographic and socioeconomic risk factors.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Previous studies assessing the effect ofmetformin on glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes have produced inconclusive results. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety ofmetformin as an adjunct to insulin in treating overweight adolescents with type 1 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter (26 pediatric endocrinology clinics), double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial involving 140 adolescents aged 12.1 to 19.6 years (mean [SD] 15.3 [1.7] years) with mean type 1 diabetes duration 7.0 (3.3) years, mean body mass index (BMI) 94th (4) percentile, mean total daily insulin 1.1 (0.2) U/kg, and mean HbA1c 8.8{\%} (0.7{\%}). INTERVENTIONS Randomization to receivemetformin (n = 71) (2000mg/d) or placebo (n = 69). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomewas change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks adjusted for baseline HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included change in blinded continuous glucose monitor indices, total daily insulin, BMI, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure, and lipids. RESULTS Between October 2013 and February 2014, 140 participants were enrolled. Baseline HbA1c was 8.8{\%} in each group. At 13-week follow-up, reduction in HbA1c was greater with metformin (-0.2{\%}) than placebo (0.1{\%}; mean difference, -0.3{\%}[95{\%}CI, -0.6{\%}to 0.0{\%}]; P = .02). However, this differential effect was not sustained at 26-week follow up when mean change in HbA1c from baseline was 0.2{\%}in each group (mean difference, 0{\%}[95{\%}CI, -0.3{\%} to 0.3{\%}]; P = .92). At 26-week follow-up, total daily insulin per kg of body weight was reduced by at least 25{\%}from baseline among 23{\%}(16) of participants in the metformin group vs 1{\%} (1) of participants in the placebo group (mean difference, 21{\%} [95{\%}CI, 11{\%} to 32{\%}]; P = .003), and 24{\%}(17) of participants in the metformin group and 7{\%}(5) of participants in the placebo group had a reduction in BMI z score of 10{\%} or greater from baseline to 26 weeks (mean difference, 17{\%}[95{\%}CI, 5{\%}to 29{\%}]; P = .01). Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by more participants in the metformin group than in the placebo group (mean difference, 36{\%}[95{\%}CI, 19{\%} to 51{\%}]; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among overweight adolescents with type 1 diabetes, the addition of metformin to insulin did not improve glycemic control after 6 months. Of multiple secondary end points, findings favored metformin only for insulin dose and measures of adiposity; conversely, use of metformin resulted in an increased risk for gastrointestinal adverse events. These results do not support prescribingmetformin to overweight adolescents with type 1 diabetes to improve glycemic control.},

abstract = {Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is a method for flexible modelling of high dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by recursive partitioning (e.g. CART) and shares its ability to capture high order interactions. However, it has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables, and produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with different multivariable interactions. This paper summarizes the basic MARS algorithm, as well as extensions for binary response, categorical predictors, nested variables and missing values. It presents tips on interpreting the output of the standard FORTRAN implementation of MARS, and provides an example of MARS applied to a set of clinical data. {\textcopyright} 1995, Sage Publications.

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) under transcriptional control of the HNF1$\beta$ transcription factor, and investigate whether its effect manifests in serum. Methods: The Polish cohort (N = 60) consisted of 11 patients with HNF1B-MODY, 17 with HNF1A-MODY, 13 with GCK-MODY, an HbA1c-matched type 1 diabetic group (n = 9) and ten healthy controls. Replication was performed in 61 clinically-matched British patients mirroring the groups in the Polish cohort. The Polish cohort underwent miRNA serum level profiling with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) arrays to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Validation was performed using qPCR. To determine whether serum content reflects alterations at a cellular level, we quantified miRNA levels in a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) with small interfering RNA knockdowns of HNF1$\alpha$ or HNF1$\beta$. Results: Significant differences (adjusted p {\textless} 0.05) were noted for 11 miRNAs. Five of them differed between HNF1A-MODY and HNF1B-MODY, and, amongst those, four (miR-24, miR-27b, miR-223 and miR-199a) showed HNF1B-MODY-specific expression levels in the replication group. In all four cases the miRNA expression level was lower in HNF1B-MODY than in all other tested groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.79 to 0.86, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 91.7{\%} (miR-24) and 82.1{\%} (miR-199a), respectively. The cellular expression pattern of miRNA was consistent with serum levels, as all were significantly higher in HNF1$\alpha$- than in HNF1$\beta$-deficient HepG2 cells. Conclusions/interpretation: We have shown that expression of specific miRNAs depends on HNF1$\beta$ function. The impact of HNF1$\beta$ deficiency was evidenced at serum level, making HNF1$\beta$-dependent miRNAs potentially applicable in the diagnosis of HNF1B-MODY.},

abstract = {Objective. Simple fasting methods to measure insulin resistance, such as the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), fasting glucose/insulin ratio (FGIR), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) methods, have been widely promoted for adult studies but have not been evaluated formally among children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to compare the HOMA, FGIR, and QUICKI methods for measuring insulin resistance, expressed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results, among obese children and adolescents. Methods. Fifty-seven pubertal obese children and adolescents (30 girls and 27 boys; mean age, 12.04 ± 2.90 years; mean BMI: 29.57 ± 5.53) participated in the study. All participants underwent an OGTT. Blood samples were obtained 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after oral glucose administration for glucose and insulin measurements, and 2 separate groups were studied, according to the presence or absence of insulin resistance. HOMA, FGIR, and QUICKI methods were studied for validation of insulin resistance determined with the OGTT for these groups. Results. The groups consisted of 25 obese children and adolescents with insulin resistance (14 girls and 11 boys; mean age: 12.88 ± 2.88 years; mean BMI: 31.29 ± 5.86) and 32 subjects without insulin resistance (16 girls and 16 boys; mean age: 11.38 ± 2.79 years; mean BMI: 28.23 ± 4.94). There were significant differences in the mean HOMA (6.06 ± 4.98 and 3.42 ± 3.14, respectively) and QUICKI (0.313 ± 0.004 and 0.339 ± 0.004, respectively) values between the 2 groups. Sensitivity and specificity calculations based on insulin resistance with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that HOMA had high sensitivity and specificity for measuring insulin resistance. Conclusions. As a measure of insulin resistance among children and adolescents, HOMA is more reliable than FGIR and QUICKI. The present HOMA cutoff point for diagnosis of insulin resistance is 3.16. The HOMA cutoff point of {\textgreater}2.5 is valid for adults but not for adolescents. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

abstract = {Background. Insulin resistance has been associated with hypertension and with renal complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Causal relationships have not been fully explained. Methods. We investigated whether insulin resistance precedes microalbuminuria by measuring insulin resistance with a euglycaemic clamp in combination with indirect calorimetry in 16 uncomplicated type 1 diabetic patients and in six healthy control subjects. The patients had over 10 year duration of diabetes, and were expected to experience either a complication-free or complicated disease course within the next few years. They have thereafter been followed for the development of microalbuminuria for 3 years. Results. In a euglycaemic insulin clamp glucose disposal was lower in diabetic patients compared with control subjects (7.5 ± 2.9 and 12.6 ± 2.0 mg/kg LBM/ min; P {\textless} 0.002), mainly due to impaired glucose storage (4.3 ± 2.3 vs 8.6 ± 1.6 mg/kg LBM/min; P {\textless} 0.001). Three years later seven IDDM patients had albumin excretion rate over 30 mg/24 h; glucose disposal (5.5 ± 2.1 vs 9.0 ± 2.2 mg/kg LBM/min; P {\textless} 0.01) had been lower in patients who developed microalbuminuria compared with those who remained normoalbuminuric. Conclusions. Insulin resistance predicts the increment in urinary albumin excretion. Insulin resistance depends mainly on impaired glucose storage in uncomplicated IDDM.},

However, little data exist on the associations of insulin resistance to lipids in Type 1 diabetes. Our objective was to explore the associations between insulin resistance (assessed by glucose infusion rate) and lipids in people with Type 1 diabetes and determine whether adiposity and/or average glycaemia influence these associations.Methods Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies were performed in 60 subjects with Type 1 diabetes aged 12-19 years (age 15 ± 2 years, 57{\%} female, duration of diabetes 6.3 ± 3.8 years, HbA1c 8.6 ± 1.5{\%}, IFCC = 70 mmol/mol) and 40 subjects with Type 1 diabetes aged 27-61 years (age 45 ± 9 years, 53{\%} female, duration of diabetes 23 ± 8 years, HbA1c 7.5 ± 0.9{\%}, IFCC = 58 mmol/mol). Multiple linear regression models were fit to examine the association between glucose infusion rate and fasting lipid levels with adjustment for possible confounders.Results Lower glucose infusion rate was significantly associated with lower levels of HDL cholesterol in youths with Type 1 diabetes and with higher levels of triglycerides and higher triglyceride/HDL ratio in both youths and adults. The magnitude of the associations between glucose infusion rate and lipid levels translate into interquartile differences of 0.098 mmol/l for HDL cholesterol, 0.17 mmol/l for triglycerides and 1.06 for triglycerides/HDL in the adolescents and 0.20 mmol/l for triglycerides and 1.01 for triglycerides/HDL in the adults. The associations were attenuated and no longer statistically significant by adjustment for adiposity among adults, while adjustment for HbA1c had a small effect in youths and adults.Conclusions Lower insulin sensitivity is associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile in both youths and adults with Type 1 diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Objectives: To determine whether children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have evidence of increased aortic stiffness or early atherosclerosis as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Background: T1DM increases risk for cardiovascular disease in adults but whether this process starts in childhood is unknown. Subjects: A total of 54 T1DM patients (15.4 ± 2.6 yr) and 30 age-matched controls (14.8 ± 2.7 yr) participated. Methods: MRI was performed to assess aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWV), strain, and distensibility of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta and measures of atherosclerosis. Results: Groups were well-matched for age, pulse pressure, and gender. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was higher in T1DM (119.3 ± 50 vs. 76.1 ± 13.5 mg/dL, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a trend toward decreased strain and distensibility in T1DM vs. controls in the ascending (distensibility: T1DM 62.2 ± 19.9 kPa-1 × 10-3, control 71.6 ± 26.4 kPa-1 × 10-3, p = 0.08) and descending aorta (strain: T1DM 25.8 ± 6.2{\%} vs. control 28.3 ± 6.8{\%}, p = 0.09). There was no difference in arch PWV. Advancing age and male gender was negatively associated with aortic stiffness. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was inversely related to descending aorta strain and distensibility (p {\textless} 0.05). Children with diabetes in the lowest two tertiles of insulin sensitivity demonstrated thoracic descending aortas with significantly lower strain (p = 0.027) and distensibility (p = 0.039) and increased measures of wall irregularity (p = 0.005). There were no differences in measurements of atherosclerosis between the two groups. Conclusions: Adolescents with T1DM, especially those with lower insulin sensitivity, demonstrated a trend toward stiffer, less compliant thoracic aortas, which was inversely associated with diabetes control. These data suggest large vessel aortopathy starts early in T1DM.},

abstract = {Background: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth is increasing. Treatment options beyond metformin and insulin are needed. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide once daily in youth (10-17 years old) with T2D were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Subjects and Methods: Youth treated with diet/exercise alone or with metformin and having a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.5-11{\%} were randomized to liraglutide (n=14) or placebo (n=7). Starting at 0.3mg/day, doses were escalated weekly to 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.8mg/day (or placebo equivalent) for 5 weeks.
Results: Nineteen participants completed the trial. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, with mean (SD) values for age of 14.8 (2.2) years, weight of 113.2 (35.6) kg (range, 57-214kg), diabetes duration of 1.7 (1.4) years, and HbA1c level of 8.1{\%} (1.2{\%}). No serious adverse events (AEs), including severe hypoglycemia, occurred. Transient gastrointestinal AEs were most common at lower liraglutide doses during dose escalation. No significant changes in safety and tolerability parameters occurred. There was no evidence of pancreatitis or lipase elevations above three times the upper normal limit; calcitonin levels remained within the normal range. For liraglutide 1.8mg, mean half-life was 12h, and clearance was 1.7L/h. After 5 weeks, the decline in HbA1c level was greater with liraglutide versus placebo (-0.86 vs. 0.04{\%}, P=0.0007), whereas mean body weight remained stable (-0.50 vs. -0.54kg, P=0.9703).
Conclusions: Liraglutide was well tolerated in youth with T2D, with safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles similar to profiles in adults. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

abstract = {Background:Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that acts as a marker of insulin sensitivity. Bloodspot sampling by fingerstick onto filter paper may increase the feasibility of large-scale studies of the determinants of insulin sensitivity. We first describe the validation of an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for quantifying adiponectin from dried blood spots and then demonstrate its application in a large trial (PROBIT).Methods:We quantified adiponectin from 3-mm diameter discs (≈3 $\mu$L of blood) punched from dried blood spots obtained from: i) whole blood standards (validation); and ii) PROBIT trial samples (application) in which paediatricians collected blood spots from 13,879 children aged 11.5 years from 31 sites across Belarus. We examined the distribution of bloodspot adiponectin by demographic and anthropometric factors, fasting insulin and glucose.Results:In the validation study, mean intra-assay coefficients of variation (n = 162) were 15{\%}, 13{\%} and 10{\%} for 'low' (6.78 $\mu$g/ml), 'medium' (18.18 $\mu$g/ml) and 'high' (33.13 $\mu$g/ml) internal quality control (IQC) samples, respectively; the respective inter-assay values (n = 40) were 23{\%}, 21{\%} and 14{\%}. The correlation coefficient between 50 paired whole bloodspot versus plasma samples, collected simultaneously, was 0.87 (95{\%} CI: 0.78 to 0.93). Recovery of known quantities of adiponectin (between 4.5 to 36 $\mu$g/ml) was 100.3-133{\%}. Bloodspot adiponectin was stable for at least 30 months at -80°C. In PROBIT, we successfully quantified fasting adiponectin from dried blood spots in 13,329 of 13,879 (96{\%}) children. Mean adiponectin (standard deviation) concentrations were 17.34 $\mu$g/ml (7.54) in boys and 18.41 $\mu$g/ml (7.92) in girls and were inversely associated with body mass index, fat mass, triceps and subscapular skin-fold thickness, waist circumference, height and fasting glucose.Conclusions:Bloodspot ELISA is suitable for measuring adiponectin in very small volumes of blood collected on filter paper and can be applied to large-scale studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Martin et al.},

abstract = {Context Insulin resistance has been proposed as one of the causes of poor glycemic control in overweight/ obese youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear. Objective To compare the effect of metformin vs. placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and other parameters in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Hypothesis Adjunctive metformin therapy will improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Design, Setting, and Participants A 9-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of metformin and placebo in 28 subjects (13m/15f) of ages 10-20years (y), with HbA1c {\textgreater}8{\%} (64 mmol/mol), BMI {\textgreater}85{\%}, and T1D {\textgreater} 12 months was conducted at a university outpatient facility. The metformin group consisted of 15 subjects (8 m/ 7f), of age 15.0 ± 2.5 y; while the control group was made up of 13 subjects (5m/ 8f), of age 14.5 ± 3.1y. All participants employed a self-directed treat-totarget insulin regimen based on a titration algorithm of (-2)-0-(+2) units to adjust their longacting insulin dose every 3rd day from -3 mo through +9 mo to maintain fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 90-120 mg/dL (5.0-6.7 mmol/L). Pubertal maturation was determined by Tanner stage. Results Over the course of the 9 months of observation, the between-treatment differences in HbA1c of 0.4{\%} (9.85{\%} [8.82 to 10.88] for placebo versus 9.46{\%} [8.47 to 10.46] for metformin) was not significant (p = 0.903). There were non-significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (189.4 mg/dL [133.2 to 245.6] for placebo versus 170.5 mg/dL [114.3 to 226.7] for metformin), (p = 0.927); total daily dose (TDD) of short-acting insulin per kg body weight/day (p = 0.936); and the TDD of long-acting insulin per kg body weight per day (1.15 units/kg/ day [0.89 to 1.41] for placebo versus 0.90 units/kg/day [0.64 to 1.16] for metformin) (p = 0.221). There was no difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between the groups. Conclusions This 9-month RCT of adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight and obese youth with T1D resulted in a 0.4{\%} lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group.},

Study participants were patients with newly diagnosed high or borderline high blood pressure or those receiving treatment for hypertension but with poor control. In total, 179 patients were recruited from three general practices, and eight doctors were involved in measuring blood pressure. Daytime ambulatory monitoring was undertaken between 0700 and 2300 hours.1A significant correlation was found between the systolic blood pressure measured by the general practitioner and daytime ambulatory systolic pressure (r=0.46; P{\&}lt;0.05). The measurements made by the doctors exceeded those obtained by ambulatory monitoring by an average of 18.9 mm Hg. The Bland-Altman method was used to plot the difference in systolic blood pressure for each patient (GP measurement minus daytime ambulatory monitoring measurement) against the mean of the two measurements (fig 1⇓).

We sought to determine the range of cardiovascular segmentation methods and how long each of these methods takes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:A systematic review of literature was undertaken. Medical imaging modality, segmentation methods, segmentation time, segmentation descriptive quality (SDQ) and segmentation software were recorded.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Totally 136 studies met the inclusion criteria (1 clinical trial; 80 journal articles; 55 conference, technical and case reports). The most frequently used image segmentation methods were brightness thresholding, region growing and manual editing, as supported by the most popular piece of proprietary software: Mimics (Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium, 1992-2015). The use of bespoke software developed by individual authors was not uncommon. SDQ indicated that reporting of image segmentation methods was generally poor with only one in three accounts providing sufficient detail for their procedure to be reproduced.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION OF KEY FINDINGS:Predominantly anecdotal and case reporting precluded rigorous assessment of risk of bias and strength of evidence. This review finds a reliance on manual and semi-automated segmentation methods which demand a high level of expertise and a significant time commitment on the part of the operator. In light of the findings, we have made recommendations regarding reporting of 3D printing studies. We anticipate that these findings will encourage the development of advanced image segmentation methods.},

abstract = {Most Active Contour Models (ACMs) deal with the image segmentation problem as a functional optimization problem, as they work on dividing an image into several regions by optimizing a suitable functional. Among ACMs, variational level set methods have been used to build an active contour with the aim of modeling arbitrarily complex shapes. Moreover, they can handle also topological changes of the contours. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) have attracted the attention of many computer vision scientists, particularly in modeling an active contour based on the idea of utilizing the prototypes (weights) of a SOM to control the evolution of the contour. SOM-based models have been proposed in general with the aim of exploiting the specific ability of SOMs to learn the edge-map information via their topology preservation property and overcoming some drawbacks of other ACMs, such as trapping into local minima of the image energy functional to be minimized in such models. In this survey, we illustrate the main concepts of variational level set-based ACMs, SOM-based ACMs, and their relationship and review in a comprehensive fashion the development of their state-of-the-art models from a machine learning perspective, with a focus on their strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract = {An open source lesion sizing toolkit has been developed with a general architecture for implementing lesion segmentation algorithms and a reference algorithm for segmenting solid and part-solid lesions from lung CT scans. The CT lung lesion segmentation algorithm detects four three-dimensional features corresponding to the lung wall, vasculature, lesion boundary edges, and low density background lung parenchyma. These features form boundaries and propagation zones that guide the evolution of a subsequent level set algorithm. User input is used to determine an initial seed point for the level set and users may also define a region of interest around the lesion. The methods are validated against 18 nodules using CT scans of an anthropomorphic thorax phantom simulating lung anatomy. The scans were acquired under differing scanner parameters to characterize algorithm behavior under varying acquisition protocols. We also validated repeatability using six clinical cases in which the patient was rescanned on the same day (zero volume change). The source code, data sets, and a running application are all provided under an unrestrictive license to encourage reproducibility and foster scientific exchange. {\textcopyright}2010 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Objective: One of the therapeutic options for patients with tuberous sclerosis (TCS) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is everolimus treatment once daily, every day, to attain trough concentrations of 5–15 ng/ml (standard treatment). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a reduced dose of everolimus (three times a week with a daily dose as in standard treatment—maintenance therapy) in a group of patients who were previously treated with standard dose for at least 12 months. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (six males, four females; median age 14.23 years) with TSC-related SEGA who met inclusion criteria were included into a single-arm, prospective trial. All the patients were followed over at least 12 months (median 12 and range 12–24 months). Tumor volumes from day 0, 90, 180, and 360 were evaluated by an experienced radiologist and an objective computer-based method and compared. Adverse events (AEs) noted during maintenance therapy were compared to the AEs observed during standard everolimus therapy. Results: The differences in SEGA volume between subsequent time points (day 0, 90, 120, and 360) were not statistically significant. No clinical symptoms of tumor regrowth were observed. AEs were significantly less severe and less frequent during maintenance compared with standard therapy. Conclusions: Maintenance therapy with reduced-dose everolimus is an effective therapeutic option for patients with TSC and SEGA after the completion of standard therapy and may moderate the rates of adverse effects.},

In brain tumor studies, the existence of abnormal tissues may be easily detectable most of the time. However, accurate and reproducible segmentation and characterization of abnormalities are not straightforward. In the past, many researchers in the field of medical imaging and soft computing have made significant survey in the field of brain tumor segmentation. Both semiautomatic and fully automatic methods have been proposed. Clinical acceptance of segmentation techniques has depended on the simplicity of the segmentation, and the degree of user supervision. Interactive or semiautomatic methods are likely to remain dominant in practice for some time, especially in these applications where erroneous interpretations are unacceptable. This article presents an overview of the most relevant brain tumor segmentation methods, conducted after the acquisition of the image. Given the advantages of magnetic resonance imaging over other diagnostic imaging, this survey is focused on MRI brain tumor segmentation.

abstract = {DNA micro-arrays now permit scientists to screen thousands of genes simultaneously and determine whether those genes are active, hyperactive or silent in normal or cancerous tissue. Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques. We propose a new method of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave-one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98{\%} accurate, while the baseline method is only 86{\%} accurate.},

In the division step, DCNPSVM divide samples into smaller sub-samples aiming at solving smaller subproblems independently. We theoretically and experimentally prove that the objective function value, solutions, and support vectors solved by DCNPSVM are close to the objective function value, solutions, and support vectors of the whole NPSVM problem. In the combination step, the sub-solutions combined as initial iteration points are used to solve the whole problem by global coordinate descent which converges quickly. In order to balance the accuracy and efficiency, we adopt a multi-level structure which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our DCNPSVM can tackle unbalance problems efficiently by tuning the parameters. Experimental results on lots of large data sets show the effectiveness of our method in memory usage, classification accuracy and time consuming.},

While this data may be useful for biomarker identification and drug discovery, the bulk of it remains underutilized. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are efficient algorithms based on the use of compositional layers of neurons, with advantages well matched to the challenges -omics data presents. While achieving state-of-the-art results and even surpassing human accuracy in many challenging tasks, the adoption of deep learning in biomedicine has been comparatively slow. Here, we discuss key features of deep learning that may give this approach an edge over other machine learning methods. We then consider limitations and review a number of applications of deep learning in biomedical studies demonstrating proof of concept and practical utility.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer (PC) includes several phenotypes, from indolent to highly aggressive cancer. Actual diagnostic and prognostic tools have several limitations, and there is a need for new biomarkers to stratify patients and assign them optimal therapies by taking into account potential genetic and epigenetic differences. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small sequences of non-coding RNA regulating specific genes involved in the onset and development of PC. Stable miRNAs have been found in biofluids, such as serum and plasma; thus, the measurement of PC-associated miRNAs is emerging as a non-invasive tool for PC detection and monitoring. In this study, we conduct an in-depth literature review focusing on miRNAs that may contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of PC. The role of miRNAs as a potential theranostic tool in PC is discussed. Using a meta-analysis approach, we found a group of 29 miRNAs with diagnostic properties and a group of seven miRNAs with prognostic properties, which were found already expressed in both biofluids and PC tissues. We tested the two miRNA groups on The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset of PC tissue samples with a machine-learning approach. Our results suggest that these 29 miRNAs should be considered as potential panel of biomarkers for the diagnosis of PC, both as in vivo non-invasive test and ex vivo confirmation test.},

abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in using machine learning approaches to priority rank studies and reduce human burden in screening literature when conducting systematic reviews. In addition, identifying addressable questions during the problem formulation phase of systematic review can be challenging, especially for topics having a large literature base. Here, we assess the performance of the SWIFT-Review priority ranking algorithm for identifying studies relevant to a given research question. We also explore the use of SWIFT-Review during problem formulation to identify, categorize, and visualize research areas that are data rich/data poor within a large literature corpus. Methods: Twenty case studies, including 15 public data sets, representing a range of complexity and size, were used to assess the priority ranking performance of SWIFT-Review. For each study, seed sets of manually annotated included and excluded titles and abstracts were used for machine training. The remaining references were then ranked for relevance using an algorithm that considers term frequency and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. This ranking was evaluated with respect to (1) the number of studies screened in order to identify 95 {\%} of known relevant studies and (2) the "Work Saved over Sampling" (WSS) performance metric. To assess SWIFT-Review for use in problem formulation, PubMed literature search results for 171 chemicals implicated as EDCs were uploaded into SWIFT-Review (264,588 studies) and categorized based on evidence stream and health outcome. Patterns of search results were surveyed and visualized using a variety of interactive graphics. Results: Compared with the reported performance of other tools using the same datasets, the SWIFT-Review ranking procedure obtained the highest scores on 11 out of 15 of the public datasets. Overall, these results suggest that using machine learning to triage documents for screening has the potential to save, on average, more than 50 {\%} of the screening effort ordinarily required when using un-ordered document lists. In addition, the tagging and annotation capabilities of SWIFT-Review can be useful during the activities of scoping and problem formulation. Conclusions: Text-mining and machine learning software such as SWIFT-Review can be valuable tools to reduce the human screening burden and assist in problem formulation.},

@article{Cavedo2014,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressing non-linear dynamic brain disease in which pathophysiological abnormalities, detectable in vivo by biological markers, precede overt clinical symptoms by many years to decades. Use of these biomarkers for the detection of early and preclinical AD has become of central importance following publication of two international expert working group's revised criteria for the diagnosis of AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, prodromal AD and preclinical AD. As a consequence of matured research evidence six AD biomarkers are sufficiently validated and partly qualified to be incorporated into operationalized clinical diagnostic criteria and use in primary and secondary prevention trials. These biomarkers fall into two molecular categories: biomarkers of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) deposition and plaque formation as well as of tau-protein related hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Three of the six gold-standard ("core feasible) biomarkers are neuroimaging measures and three are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes. CSF A$\beta$1-42 (A$\beta$1-42), also expressed as A$\beta$1-42 : A$\beta$1-40 ratio, T-tau, and P-tau Thr181 {\&} Thr231 proteins have proven diagnostic accuracy and risk enhancement in prodromal MCI and AD dementia. Conversely, having all three biomarkers in the normal range rules out AD. Intermediate conditions require further patient follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at increasing field strength and resolution allows detecting the evolution of distinct types of structural and functional abnormality pattern throughout early to late AD stages. Anatomical or volumetric MRI is the most widely used technique and provides local and global measures of atrophy. The revised diagnostic criteria for "prodromal AD" and "mild cognitive impairment due to AD" include hippocampal atrophy (as the fourth validated biomarker), which is considered an indicator of regional neuronal injury. Advanced image analysis techniques generate automatic and reproducible measures both in regions of interest, such as the hippocampus and in an exploratory fashion, observer and hypothesis-indedendent, throughout the entire brain. Evolving modalities such as diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced tractography as well as resting-state functional MRI provide useful additionally useful measures indicating the degree of fiber tract and neural network disintegration (structural, effective and functional connectivity) that may substantially contribute to early detection and the mapping of progression. These modalities require further standardization and validation. The use of molecular in vivo amyloid imaging agents (the fifth validated biomarker), such as the Pittsburgh Compound-B and markers of neurodegeneration, such as fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) (as the sixth validated biomarker) support the detection of early AD pathological processes and associated neurodegeneration. How to use, interpret, and disclose biomarker results drives the need for optimized standardization. Multimodal AD biomarkers do not evolve in an identical manner but rather in a sequential but temporally overlapping fashion. Models of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers can take the form of plots of biomarker severity (degree of abnormality) versus time. AD biomarkers can be combined to increase accuracy or risk. A list of genetic risk factors is increasingly included in secondary prevention trials to stratify and select individuals at genetic risk of AD. Although most of these biomarker candidates are not yet qualified and approved by regulatory authorities for their intended use in drug trials, they are nonetheless applied in ongoing clinical studies for the following functions: (i) inclusion/exclusion criteria, (ii) patient stratification, (iii) evaluation of treatment effect, (iv) drug target engagement, and (v) safety. Moreover, novel promising hypothesis-driven, as well as exploratory biochemical, genetic, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging markers for use in clinical trials are being developed. The current state-of-the-art and future perspectives on both biological and neuroimaging derived biomarker discovery and development as well as the intended application in prevention trials is outlined in the present publication.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging studies place great emphasis on not only the estimation but also the standard error estimates of underlying parameters derived from a temporal model. This allows inferences to be made about the signal estimates and resulting conclusions to be drawn about the underlying data. It can often be advantageous to interrogate temporal models after spatial transformation of the data into the wavelet domain. Wavelet bases provide a multiresolution decomposition of the spatial data dimension and an ensuing reduction in spatial correlation. However, widespread acceptance of these wavelet techniques has been hampered by the limited ability to reconstruct both parametric and error estimates into the image domain after analysis of temporal models in the wavelet domain. This paper introduces a derivation and a fast implementation of a method for the calculation of the variance of the parametric images obtained from wavelet filters. The technique is proposed for a class of estimators that have been shown to be useful in neuroimaging studies. The techniques are demonstrated for both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data sets. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we examine, using time series spectral methods, whether such stationary assumptions can be made and whether estimates of non-stationarity can be used to gain understanding into fMRI experiments. A non-stationary version of replicated stationary time series analysis is proposed that takes into account the replicated time series that are available from nearby voxels in a region of interest (ROI). These are used to investigate non-stationarities in both the ROI itself and the variations within the ROI.

abstract = {Aim: To investigate ataxia rating scales in children for reliability and the effect of age and sex. Method: Three independent neuropaediatric observers cross-sectionally scored a set of paediatric ataxia rating scales in a group of 52 healthy children (26 males, 26 females) aged 4 to 16 years (mean age 10y 5mo SD 3y 11mo). The investigated scales involved the commonly applied International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS), and PEG-board tests. We investigated the interrelatedness between individual ataxia scales, the influence of age and sex, inter- and intra-observer agreement, and test-retest reliability. Results: Spearman's rank correlations revealed strong correlations between ICARS, SARA BARS, and PEG-board test (all p{\textless}0.001). ICARS, SARA, BARS and PEG-board test outcomes were age-dependent until 12.5, 10, 11, and 11.5 years of age respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) varied between moderate and almost perfect (interobserver agreement: 0.85, 0.72, and 0.69; intraobserver agreement: 0.92, 0.94, and 0.70; and test-retest reliability: 0.95, 0.50, and 0.71; for ICARS, SARA, and BARS respectively). Interobserver variability decreased after the sixth year of life. Interpretation: In healthy children, ataxia rating scales are reliable, but should include age-dependent interpretation in children up to 12 years of age. To enable longitudinal interpretation of quantitative ataxia rating scales in children, European paediatric normative values are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mac Keith Press.},

abstract = {Purpose: The detrimental effect of frequent early seizures on the cognitive potential of children is a significant clinical issue. Epilepsy surgery in childhood offers a good prognosis for seizure control and improved developmental outcome. We studied the postoperative outcome and the developmental velocity after surgery and analyzed risk factors for developmental delay in 50 consecutive preschool children treated surgically for severe epilepsy at ages 3 to 7 years. Methods: Pre- and postoperative developmental quotients (DQs) were analyzed with analysis of variance; stepwise linear regressions were performed on preoperative DQs and on a difference score between post- and preoperative DQs to determine risk factors for preoperative development and factors influencing postoperative development. Results: Of the 50 patients, 70{\%} were retarded, with IQ {\textless} 70; 16{\%} were of average intelligence, with IQ ranging from 85 to 115. Age at seizure onset and extent of lesion were predictive variables for preoperative cognitive development. Six to 12 months after surgery (early postoperative phase), 66{\%} were seizure free (Engel outcome class I), 26{\%} had substantial to worthwhile seizure reduction (classes II and III), and 8{\%} were unchanged (class IV). Forty-one (82{\%}) children showed stable velocity of development; three children showed gains of ≥ 15 IQ points; three had developmental decline (loss of ≥ 10 IQ points), which was transient in two children; and three children moved from not assessable to assessable. At last follow-up (6 months to 10 years after surgery), 11 children showed IQ/DQ gains of ≥ 15 IQ points. Gains in IQ were observed only in seizure-free children and were stable over time. Shorter duration of epilepsy was significantly associated with a postoperative increase in DQ. Conclusions: (a) Substantial global mental delay is common in young children treated for epilepsy with surgery; (b) In most patients, postoperative development proceeded at a stable velocity; (c) Catch-up development may occur but only in seizure-free patients; (d) Substantial cognitive losses were noted in only one child, and (e) Early seizure control stabilized developmental velocity in this patient cohort. {\textcopyright} 2005 International League Against Epilepsy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on joint regression and classification for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and propose a new feature selection method by embedding the relational information inherent in the observations into a sparse multi-task learning framework. Specifically, the relational information includes three kinds of relationships (such as feature-feature relation, response–response relation, and sample-sample relation), for preserving three kinds of the similarity, such as for the features, the response variables, and the samples, respectively. To conduct feature selection, we first formulate the objective function by imposing these three relational characteristics along with an ℓ2,1-norm regularization term, and further propose a computationally efficient algorithm to optimize the proposed objective function. With the dimension-reduced data, we train two support vector regression models to predict the clinical scores of ADAS-Cog and MMSE, respectively, and also a support vector classification model to determine the clinical label. We conducted extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our experimental results showed the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing the performances of both clinical scores prediction and disease status identification, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

We addressed the task of the new features to identify GBM using T1 and T2 weighted images (T1-WI, T2-WI) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MR images. A pathologic area was detected using multithresholding segmentation with morphological operations of MR images. Multiclassifier techniques were considered to evaluate the performance of the feature based scheme in terms of its capability to discriminate GBM and normal tissue. GMM features demonstrated the best performance by the comparative study using principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet based features. For the T1-WI, the accuracy performance was 97.05{\%} (AUC = 92.73{\%}) with 0.00{\%} missed detection and 2.95{\%} false alarm. In the T2-WI, the same accuracy (97.05{\%}, AUC = 91.70{\%}) value was achieved with 2.95{\%} missed detection and 0.00{\%} false alarm. In FLAIR mode the accuracy decreased to 94.11{\%} (AUC = 95.85{\%}) with 0.00{\%} missed detection and 5.89{\%} false alarm. These experimental results are promising to enhance the characteristics of heterogeneity and hence early treatment of GBM.},

abstract = {Introduction: The toxic effects of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) and platinum-based chemotherapy on cognition in the lung cancer population have not yet been well established. In the present study we examined the longitudinal neuropsychological and brain structural changes observed in patients with lung cancer who were undergoing these treatments. Methods: Twenty-two patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who underwent platinum-based chemotherapy and PCI were compared with two control groups: an age- and education-matched group of healthy controls (n = 21) and a group of patients with non-SCLC (NSCLC, n = 13) who underwent platinum-based chemotherapy. All groups were evaluated using a neuropsychological battery and multimodal structural magnetic resonance imaging: T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging at baseline (before PCI for SCLC and chemotherapy for NSCLC) and at 3 months after treatment. T1 voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to analyze microstructural changes in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core Questionnaire was also completed. Results: Patients with SCLC exhibited cognitive deterioration in verbal fluency over time. Structural magnetic resonance imaging showed decreases in GM at 3 months in the right subcortical regions, bilateral insular cortex, and superior temporal gyrus in patients with SCLC compared with both control groups. Additionally, patients with SCLC showed decreases in GMover time in the aforementioned regions plus in the right parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, together with changes in the WM microstructure of the entire corpus callosum. These changes had a limited impact on responses to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core Questionnaire, however. Patients with NSCLC showed no cognitive or brain structural differences after chemotherapy. Conclusions: This longitudinal study documents moderate neuropsychological deficits together with notable brainspecific structural changes (in GM and WM) in patients with SCLC after chemotherapy and PCI, suggesting that chemotherapy and especially PCI are associated with the development of cognitive and structural brain toxic effects.},

abstract = {Background: Disease and therapy cause brain damage and subsequent functional loss in pediatric patients with posterior fossa tumors. Treatment-related toxicity factors are resection in patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and, additionally, cranio-spinal irradiation together with chemotherapy in patients with medulloblastoma (MB). We tested whether damage to white matter (WM) as revealed by diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) correlated with specific cognitive and motor impairments in survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumors. Procedures: Eighteen MB (mean age±SD, 15.2±4.9 y) and 14 PA (12.6±5.0 y) survivors were investigated with DTI on a 3-Tesla-MR system. We identified fractional anisotropy (FA) of WM, the volume ratio of WM to gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid (WM/GM+CSF), and volume of specific frontocerebellar tracts. Ataxia was assessed using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), while the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children determined full-scale intelligence quotients (FSIQ). Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT) was used to assess processing speed. Handwriting automation was analyzed using a digitizing graphic tablet. Results: The WM/GM+CSF ratio correlated significantly with cognitive measures (IQ, P=0.002; ANT baseline speed, P=0.04; ANT shifting attention, P=0.004). FA of skeletonized tracts correlated significantly with FSIQ (P=0.008), ANT baseline speed (P=0.028) and ANT shifting attention (P=0.045). Moreover, frontocerebellar tract volumes correlated with both the FSIQ (P=0.011) and ICARS (P=0.007). Conclusion: DTI provides a method for quantification of WM damage by tumor and by therapy-associated effects in survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumors. DTI-derived WM integrity may be a representative marker for cognitive and motor deterioration. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2015;62:1252-1258.},

Patients and Methods: Follow-up study of surviving UK patients with medulloblastoma diagnosed between 1992 and 2000 treated according to one or other treatment arm of the PNET 3 controlled trial. Results: Seventy three percent of all 147 eligible patients ages 6.6 to 24.3 years were assessed at a mean of 7.2 years after diagnosis. Health status was significantly poorer in the group treated in the CSI plus CT arm of the trial than in the CSI alone arm, and there were also trends to poorer outcomes for behavior and quality of life scores. The CSI plus CT group were also significantly more restricted physically and needed more therapeutic and educational support. Body mass index, stature, and other endocrine outcomes were similar in the two treatment arms, except for the trend in increased frequency of medical induction of puberty in the CSI plus CT group. Conclusion: The addition of CT to CSI for medulloblastoma was associated with a significant decrease in health status.

abstract = {Purpose: To elucidate morphologic correlates of brain dysfunction in pediatric survivors of posterior fossa tumors by using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine neuroaxonal integrity in white matter. Patients and Methods: Seventeen medulloblastoma (MB) patients who had received surgery and adjuvant treatment, 13 pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) patients who had been treated only with surgery, and age-matched healthy control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging on a 3-Tesla system. High-resolution conventional T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and DTI data sets were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics, a part of the Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library. Results: Compared with control subjects, FA values of MB patients were significantly decreased in the cerebellar midline structures, in the frontal lobes, and in the callosal body. Fractional anisotropy values of the PA patients were not only decreased in cerebellar hemispheric structures as expected, but also in supratentorial parts of the brain, with a distribution similar to that in MB patients. However, the amount of significantly decreased FA was greater in MB than in PA patients, underscoring the aggravating neurotoxic effect of the adjuvant treatment. Conclusions: Neurotoxic mechanisms that are present in PA patients (e.g., internal hydrocephalus and damaged cerebellar structures affecting neuronal circuits) contribute significantly to the alteration of supratentorial white matter in pediatric posterior fossa tumor patients. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have deficits in neurocognitive performance, and smaller white-matter volumes are associated with these deficits. METHODS. The patients studied included 112 ALL survivors (84 patients who had received chemotherapy only, 28 patients who had received chemotherapy and irradiation; 63 males, 49 females; mean age ± standard deviation, 4.1 yrs ± 2.6 yrs at diagnosis; mean ± standard deviation yrs since diagnosis, 6.0 ± 3.5 yrs), and 33 healthy siblings who participated as a control group. Neurocognitive tests of attention, intelligence, and academic achievement were performed; and magnetic resonance images were obtained and subsequently were segmented to yield tissue volume measurements. Comparisons of neurocognitive measures and tissue volumes between groups were performed, and the correlations between volumes and neurocognitive performance measures were assessed. RESULTS. Most performance measures demonstrated statistically significant differences from the normative test scores, but only attention measures exceeded 1.0 standard deviation from normal. Patients who had received chemotherapy alone had significantly larger volumes of white matter than patients who had received treatment that also included cranial irradiation, but their volumes remained significantly smaller than the volumes in the control group. Smaller white-matter volumes were associated significantly with larger deficits in attention, intelligence, and academic achievement. CONCLUSIONS. Survivors of childhood ALL had significant deficits in attention and smaller white-matter volumes that were associated directly with impaired neurocognitive performance. Cranial irradiation exacerbated these deficits. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Cancer Society.},

abstract = {This study examined whether lesions to the cerebellum obtained in early childhood are better compensated than lesions in middle childhood or adolescence. Since cerebellar lesions might affect motor as well a cognitive performance, posture, upper limb and working memory function were assessed in 22 patients after resection of a cerebellar tumour (age at surgery 1-17 years, minimum 3 years post-surgery). Working memory was only impaired in those patients who had received chemo- or radiation therapy. Postural sway was enhanced in 64{\%} of the patients during dynamic posturography conditions, which relied heavily on vestibular input for equilibrium control. Upper limb function was generally less impaired, but 54{\%} of the patients revealed prolonged deceleration times in an arm pointing task, which probably does not reflect a genuine cerebellar deficit but rather the patients' adopted strategy to avoid overshooting. Age at surgery, time since surgery or lesion volume were poor predictors of motor or cognitive recovery. Brain imaging analysis revealed that lesions of all eight patients with abnormal posture who did not receive chemo- and/or radiation therapy included the fastigial and interposed nuclei (NF and NI). In patients with normal posture, NI and NF were spared. In 11 out of 12 patients with abnormal deceleration time, the region with the highest overlap included the NI and NF and dorsomedial portions of the dentate nuclei in 10 out of 12 patients. We conclude that cerebellar damage inflicted at a young age is not necessarily better compensated. The lesion site is critical for motor recovery, and lesions affecting the deep cerebellar nuclei are not fully compensated at any developmental age in humans.

abstract = {As survival among children treated for cancer continues to improve, more attention is being focussed on the late effects of cancer treatment. In children treated for brain tumours, chronic neurocognitive effects are especially challenging. Deficits in cognitive development have been described most thoroughly among children treated for posterior-fossa tumours, specifically medulloblastomas and ependymomas, which account for about 30{\%} of all newly diagnosed cases of brain tumours in children. Most children who have survived brain tumours have required surgical resection and focal or craniospinal radiotherapy (irradiation of the entire subarachnoid volume of the brain and spine), with or without systemic chemotherapy. Historically, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores have provided a benchmark against which to measure changes in cognitive development after treatment. Observed declines in IQ are most likely a result of failure to learn at a rate that is appropriate for the age of the child, rather than from a loss of previously acquired knowledge. The rate of IQ decline is associated with a several risk factors, including younger age at time of treatment, longer time since treatment, female sex, as well as clinical variables such as hydrocephalus, use of radiotherapy and radiotherapy dose, and the volume of the brain that received treatment. Loss of cerebral white matter and failure to develop white matter at a rate appropriate to the developmental stage of the child could partly account for changes in IQ score. Technical advances in radiotherapy hold promise for lowering the frequency of neurocognitive sequelae. Further efforts to limit neurocognitive sequelae have included design of clinical trials to test the effectiveness of cognitive, behavioural, and pharmacological interventions.},

abstract = {Object. Brain tumors are the most common category of childhood solid tumors. In the 1970s and 1980s, treatment protocols for benign tumors focused almost exclusively on surgery, with radiation treatment as a salvage modality, whereas the management of malignant tumors employed a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, with therapeutic approaches such as "8-in-1" chemotherapy often applied across histological tumor subsets that are now recognized to be prognostically distinct. During the ensuing years, treatment has become increasingly refined, based on clinical and, more recently, molecular factors, which have supported risk-adapted treatment stratification. The goal of this report is to provide an overview of recent progress in the field. Methods. A review of the literature was undertaken to examine recent advances in the management of the most common childhood brain tumor subsets, and in particular to identify instances in which molecular categorization and treatment stratification offer evidence or promise for improving outcome. Results. For both medulloblastomas and infant tumors, refinements in clinical and molecular stratification have already facilitated efforts to achieve risk-adapted treatment planning. Current treatment strategies for children with these tumors focus on improving outcome for tumor subsets that have historically been relatively resistant to therapy and reducing treatment-related sequelae for children with therapy-responsive tumors. Recent advances in molecular categorization offer the promise of further refinements in future studies. For children with ependymomas and low-grade gliomas, clinical risk stratification has facilitated tailored approaches to therapy, with improvement of disease control and concomitant reduction in treatment sequelae, and recent discoveries have identified promising therapeutic targets for molecularly based therapy. In contrast, the prognosis remains poor for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and other high-grade gliomas, despite recent identification of biological correlates of tumor prognosis and elucidation of molecular substrates of tumor development. Conclusions. Advances in the clinical and molecular stratification for many types of childhood brain tumors have provided a foundation for risk-adapted treatment planning and improvements in outcome. In some instances, molecular characterization approaches have also yielded insights into new therapeutic targets. For other tumor types, outcome remains discouraging, although new information regarding the biological features critical to tumorigenesis are being translated into novel therapeutic approaches that hold promise for future improvements.},

Patients and Methods: Out of 623 children diagnosed with cancer between 1995-2005, 110 were treated for brain tumors and followed-up, with a mean survival of 11.4 years. Results: Overall 5-year survival in the whole cohort was 60.9±4.7{\%}, while 10-year survival was 58.2±4.7{\%}. No relapse, progression or death occurred after six years from initial diagnosis. Survival was 48.1±9.6{\%} for patients with medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors; 83.3±6.2{\%} for low-grade astrocytoma; 56.6±16.6{\%} for ependymoma, while 0{\%} at 72 months for high-grade glioma. Patients with cerebellar tumors had a survival rate 69.0±7.1{\%} at 10 years. Multivariate analysis showed that factors predicting poor outcome were: grade III-IV tumor, incomplete surgical resection, and complications after surgical resection, while diagnosis of low-grade glioma was the only factor predicting good outcome. Progression of the disease during therapy was an additional independent adverse risk factor for survival. Conclusion: Long-term survival was achieved by 58{\%} of children with brain tumors. Advanced tumor stage, incomplete surgical resection, complications of surgical treatment, and progression of the disease during treatment predicted poor outcome.},

abstract = {Digestive trypsins undergo proteolytic breakdown during their transit in the human alimentary tract, which has been assumed to occur through trypsin-mediated cleavages, termed autolysis. Autolysis was also postulated to play a protective role against pancreatitis by eliminating prematurely activated intrapancreatic trypsin. However, autolysis of human cationic trypsin is very slow in vitro, which is inconsistent with the documented intestinal trypsin degradation or a putative protective role. Here we report that degradation of human cationic trypsin is triggered by chymotrypsin C, which selectively cleaves the Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond within the Ca2+ binding loop. Further degradation and inactivation of cationic trypsin is then achieved through tryptic cleavage of the Arg122-Val123 peptide bond. Consequently, mutation of either Leu81 or Arg 122 blocks chymotrypsin C-mediated trypsin degradation. Calcium affords protection against chymotrypsin C-mediated cleavage, with complete stabilization observed at 1 mM concentration. Chymotrypsin C is highly specific in promoting trypsin degradation, because chymotrypsin B1, chymotrypsin B2, elastase 2A, elastase 3A, or elastase 3B are ineffective. Chymotrypsin C also rapidly degrades all three human trypsinogen isoforms and appears identical to enzyme Y, the enigmatic trypsinogen-degrading activity described by Heinrich Rinderknecht in 1988. Taken together with previous observations, the results identify chymotrypsin C as a key regulator of activation and degradation of cationic trypsin. Thus, in the high Ca2+ environment of the duodenum, chymotrypsin C facilitates trypsinogen activation, whereas in the lower intestines, chymotrypsin C promotes trypsin degradation as a function of decreasing luminal Ca2+ concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We review how to manage patients with acute pancreatitis, paying attention to diagnosis, differential diagnosis, complications, prognostic factors, treatment, and prevention of second attacks, and the possible transition from acute to chronic pancreatitis.},

abstract = {Background and aims: The prevalence and natural history of hereditary pancreatitis (HP) remain poorly documented. The aims of this study were to assess genetic, epidemiological, clinical and morphological characteristics of HP in an extensive national survey. Methods: A cohort comprising all HP patients was constituted by contacting all gastroenterologists and paediatricians (response rate 84{\%}) and genetics laboratories (response rate 100{\%}) in France (60 200 000 inhabitants). Inclusion criteria were the presence of mutation in the cationic trypsingen gene (PRSS1 gene), or chronic pancreatitis in at least two first-degree relatives, or three second-degree relatives, in the absence of precipitating factors for pancreatitis. Results: 78 families and 200 patients were included (181 alive, 6673 person-years, males 53{\%}, alcoholism 5{\%}, smoking 34{\%}). The prevalence was 0.3/100 000 inhabitants. PRSS1 mutations were detected in 68{\%} (R122H 78{\%}, N29I 12{\%}, others 10{\%}). Penetrance was 93{\%}. Median age at first symptom, diagnosis and date of last news, were 10 (range 1-73), 19 (1-80) and 30 (1-84) years, respectively. HP was responsible for pancreatic pain (83{\%}), acute pancreatitis (69{\%}), pseudocysts (23{\%}), cholestasis (3{\%}), pancreatic calcifications (61{\%}), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (34{\%}, median age of occurrence 29 years), diabetes mellitus (26{\%}, median age of occurrence 38 years) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (5{\%}, median age 55 years). No differences in clinical and morphological data according to genetic status were observed. 19 patients died, including 10 directly from HP (8 from pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Conclusion: The prevalence of HP in France is at least 0.3/100 000. PRSS1 gene mutations are found in 2/3 with a 93{\%} penetrance. Mutation type is not correlated with clinical/morphological expression. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the cause of nearly half the deaths.},

abstract = {Background and aims: Two common haplotypes of the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) gene have been shown to increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis. A haplotype comprising the c.101A{\textgreater}G (p.N34S) missense variant and four intronic alterations has been found worldwide, whereas a second haplotype consisting of the c.-215G{\textgreater}A promoter variant and the c.194+2T7gt;C intronic alteration has been observed frequently in Japan. Methods: In the present study, the functional significance of the intronic variants in the pathogenic SPINK1 haplotypes was examined by utilising minigenes, which harbour individual introns placed in the appropriate context of the full-length SPINK1 cDNA. Cells transfected with the SPINK1 minigenes secrete active trypsin inhibitor, thereby allowing evaluation of mutational effects simultaneously on transcription, splicing, translation and secretion. Results: It was found that the c.194+2T{\textgreater}C intronic alteration abolished SPINK1 expression at the mRNA level, with consequent loss of inhibitor secretion, whereas the p.N34S-associated intronic variants had no detectable functional effect. Conclusions: Taken together with previous studies, the results indicate that all known variants within the p.N34S- associated haplotype are functionally innocuous, suggesting that an as yet unidentified variant within this haplotype is responsible for the pathogenic effect. The marked negative impact of the c.194+2T{\textgreater}C variant on SPINK1 expression supports the notion that SPINK1 variants increase the risk of chronic pancreatitis by diminishing protective trypsin inhibitor levels.},

abstract = {Background and objective: The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis enabled standardised reporting of research and aided communication between clinicians. Deficiencies identified and improved understanding of the disease make a revision necessary. Methods: A web-based consultation was undertaken in 2007 to ensure wide participation of pancreatologists. After an initial meeting, the Working Group sent a draft document to 11 national and international pancreatic associations. This working draft was forwarded to all members. Revisions were made in response to comments, and the web-based consultation was repeated three times. The final consensus was reviewed, and only statements based on published evidence were retained. Results: The revised classi fication of acute pancreatitis identified two phases of the disease: early and late. Severity is classified as mild, moderate or severe. Mild acute pancreatitis, the most common form, has no organ failure, local or systemic complications and usually resolves in the first week. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of transient organ failure, local complications or exacerbation of co-morbid disease. Severe acute pancreatitis is defined by persistent organ failure, that is, organ failure {\textgreater}48 h. Local complications are peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (sterile or infected), pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis (sterile or infected). We present a standardised template for reporting CT images. Conclusions: This international, web-based consensus provides clear de finitions to classify acute pancreatitis using easily identified clinical and radiologic criteria. The wide consultation among pancreatologists to reach this consensus should encourage widespread adoption.},

abstract = {In this Topic Highlight, the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of acute pancreatitis in children are discussed. Acute pancreatitis should be considered during the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in children and requires prompt treatment because it may become life-threatening. The etiology, clinical manifestations, and course of acute pancreatitis in children are often different than in adults. Therefore, the specific features of acute pancreatitis in children must be considered. The etiology of acute pancreatitis in children is often drugs, infections, trauma, or anatomic abnormalities. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms (such as abdominal pain and vomiting), serum pancreatic enzyme levels, and imaging studies. Several scoring systems have been proposed for the assessment of severity, which is useful for selecting treatments and predicting prognosis. The basic pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis does not greatly differ between adults and children, and the treatments for adults and children are similar. In large part, our understanding of the pathology, optimal treatment, assessment of severity, and outcome of acute pancreatitis in children is taken from the adult literature. However, we often find that the common management of adult pancreatitis is difficult to apply to children. With advances in diagnostic techniques and treatment methods, severe acute pancreatitis in children is becoming better understood and more controllable.},

abstract = {Background: In predicted severe acute pancreatitis, many patients develop organ failure and recover without local complications, and mortality is only 14-30{\%}. It has been suggested that half of patients with progressive early organ failure may die, but there are no data to relate death or local complications to duration of early (week 1) organ failure. Aims: To determine mortality rates in patients with transient ({\textless}48 hours) and persistent ({\textgreater}48 hours) early organ failure and to show whether persistent organ failure predicts death or local complications. Patients: A total of 290 patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis previously studied in a trial of lexipafant, recruited from 78 hospitals through 18 centres in the UK. Method: Manual review of trial database to determine: the presence of organ Failure (Marshall score ≥2) on each of the first seven days in hospital, duration of organ failure, and outcome of pancreatitis (death, complications by Atlanta criteria). Results: Early organ failure was present in 174 (60{\%}) patients. After transient organ failure (n = 71), outcome was good: one death and 29{\%} local complications. Persistent organ failure (n = 103) was followed by 36 deaths and 77{\%} local complications, irrespective of onset of organ failure on admission or later during the first week. Conclusion: Duration of organ failure during the first week of predicted severe acute pancreatitis is strongly associated with the risk of death or local complications. Resolution of organ failure within 48 hours suggests a good prognosis; persistent organ failure is a marker for subsequent death or local complications.},

abstract = {Acute pancreatitis is a common disease most frequently caused by gallstone disease or excess alcohol ingestion. Diagnosis is usually based on characteristic symptoms, often in conjunction with elevated serum pancreatic enzymes. Imaging is not always necessary, but may be performed for many reasons, such as to confirm a diagnosis of pancreatitis, rule out other causes of abdominal pain, elucidate the cause of pancreatitis, or to evaluate for complications such as necrosis or pseudocysts. Though the majority of patients will have mild, self-limiting disease, some will develop severe disease associated with organ failure. These patients are at risk to develop complications from ongoing pancreatic inflammation such as pancreatic necrosis, fluid collections, pseudocysts, and pancreatic duct disruption. Validated scoring systems can help predict the severity of pancreatitis, and thus, guide monitoring and intervention. Treatment of acute pancreatitis involves supportive care with fluid replacement, pain control, and controlled initiation of regular food intake. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in acute pancreatitis if there is no evidence of pancreatic infection. In patients who fail to improve, further evaluation is necessary to assess for complications that require intervention such as pseudocysts or pancreatic necrosis. Endoscopy, including ERCP and EUS, and/or cholecystectomy may be indicated in the appropriate clinical setting. Ultimately, the management of the patient with severe acute pancreatitis will require a multidisciplinary approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Hospital Medicine.},

abstract = {Background: Genetic predisposition in paediatric idiopathic acute, acute recurrent pancreatitis and its consequences are unknown. We studied frequency of genetic markers in acute, acute recurrent, chronic pancreatitis and their impact on natural history. Methods: Over a period of 2 years 68 consecutive children with pancreatitis (35.3{\%} acute, 32.3{\%} acute recurrent, 32.3{\%} chronic) and 25 controls were recruited in a single centre. Common mutations for serine-protease-inhibitor (SPINK1 N34S), protease-inhibitor (PRSS1 R122H) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR DeltaF508, 5T) were analysed. Results: Mean age was 13.4. ± 2.5 years. Overall, 30 cases (SPINK1 N34S n= 26, CFTR 5T n= 4) and 1 control (SPINK1 N34S) had mutations (p= 0.0001). The prevalence of SPINK1 N34S mutation was similar in chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis (45{\%}). Six children with severe acute pancreatitis had SPINK1 N34S mutations (25{\%}, p{\textless} 0.05), and 4 were homozygous. On follow-up 5 acute pancreatitis patients with mutations and 1 without mutations developed chronic pancreatitis ( p= 0.004); 8 cases of acute recurrent pancreatitis progressed to chronic pancreatitis (38{\%}); of these 66.7{\%} had mutations vs. 16.7{\%} who did not (p= 0.03). Conclusions: Almost 50{\%} of idiopathic chronic, acute recurrent and 33{\%} of acute pancreatitis in children are genetically predisposed. Presence of genetic mutations in acute and recurrent acute pancreatitis increases the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis.},

abstract = {Background/objectives There are limitations and challenges with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) in children. We evaluated the diagnostic yield and concordance for serum pancreatic enzymes and imaging in children with AP. Methods A retrospective review of laboratory and radiographic results within 96 h of AP presentation (January 2000-July 2011) was performed at two paediatric hospitals. Observed agreement and kappa statistics ($\kappa$) were determined between outcomes of bloods (lipase and/or amylase) and imaging (ultrasound (US) and/or computed tomography (CT)). Results A total of 103/131 (79{\%}) AP cases had both bloods and imaging performed (within 96 h). Overall, lipase, amylase, US and CT were consistent with an AP diagnosis in 93{\%} (93/100), 54{\%} (43/80), 27{\%} (21/77) and 67{\%} (28/42) of cases respectively. The diagnostic yield for combinations of blood(s) and imaging(s) tests was higher than any single test and blood tests alone. The observed agreement between bloods 'lipase or amylase' and imaging 'US or CT,' was 40{\%}. The $\kappa$ was -0.083 suggesting no agreement. In 55{\%} of cases, enzymes were positive whilst imaging was negative and the converse was evident in 5{\%} of cases. There was no agreement between the various diagnostic tests, except between amylase and US, which had fair agreement. Conclusion Elevations in serum lipase contributed to the diagnosis more often than other tests. Combinations of blood(s) and imaging(s) tests have an increased diagnostic yield. Serum enzyme elevation and imaging changes poorly correlated. At least 5{\%} of cases of AP may be missed if imaging is not performed. {\textcopyright} 2014, IAP and EPC.

abstract = {Hereditary pancreatitis, an autosomal dominant disease with ∼80{\%} penetrance, can be caused by both 'gain-of-function' missense and copy number mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1). Here we demonstrate a heterozygous hybrid PRSS2 (encoding anionic trypsinogen)/ PRSS1 gene in a French white family with hereditary pancreatitis, by means of quantitative fluorescent multiplex PCR and RT-PCR analyses. The hybrid gene, in which exons 1 and 2 are derived from PRSS2 and exons 3-5 from PRSS1, apparently resulted from a non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) event between the chromosome 7 homologs or sister chromatids during meiosis. Interestingly, this hybrid gene causes the disease through a combination of its inherent 'double gain-of-function' effect, acting simultaneously as a 'quantitative' copy number mutation and a 'qualitative' missense mutation (i.e. the known disease-causing p.N29I mutation). Our finding reveals a previously unknown mechanism causing human inherited disease, enriches the lexicon of human genetic variation and goes beyond the known interaction between copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide substitutions in health and disease. Our finding should also stimulate more interest in analyzing both types of genetic variation whenever one tries to determine the contribution of a specific locus to a given disease phenotype. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop a simple, physiologically based mathematical model of pancreatic duct cell secretion using experimentally derived parameters that generates pancreatic fluid bicarbonate concentrations of {\textgreater}140 mM after CFTR activation. Methods: A new mathematical model was developed simulating a duct cell within a proximal pancreatic duct and included a sodium-2-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) and sodium-potassium pump (NaK pump) on a chloride-impermeable basolateral membrane, CFTR on the luminal membrane with 0.2 to 1 bicarbonate to chloride permeability ratio. Chloride-bicarbonate antiporters (Cl−/HCO3−AP) were added or subtracted from the basolateral (APb) and luminal (APl) membranes. The model was integrated over time using XPPAUT. Results: This model predicts robust, NaK pump-dependent bicarbonate secretion with opening of the CFTR, generates and maintains pancreatic fluid secretion with bicarbonate concentrations {\textgreater}140 mM, and returns to basal levels with CFTR closure. Limiting CFTR permeability to bicarbonate, as seen in some CFTR mutations, markedly inhibited pancreatic bicarbonate and fluid secretion. Conclusions: A simple CFTR-dependent duct cell model can explain active, high-volume, high-concentration bicarbonate secretion in pancreatic juice that reproduces the experimental findings.

abstract = {Chronic pancreatitis is a common inflammatory disease of the pancreas. Mutations in the genes encoding cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) and the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) are associated with chronic pancreatitis. Because increased proteolytic activity owing to mutated PRSS1 enhances the risk for chronic pancreatitis, mutations in the gene encoding anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2) may also predispose to disease. Here we analyzed PRSS2 in individuals with chronic pancreatitis and controls and found, to our surprise, that a variant of codon 191 (G191R) is overrepresented in control subjects: G191R was present in 220/6,459 (3.4{\%}) controls but in only 32/2,466 (1.3{\%}) affected individuals (odds ratio 0.37; P ≤ 1.1 × 10-8). Upon activation by enterokinase or trypsin, purified recombinant G191R protein showed a complete loss of trypsin activity owing to the introduction of a new tryptic cleavage site that renders the enzyme hypersensitive to autocatalytic proteolysis. In conclusion, the G191R variant of PRSS2 mitigates intrapancreatic trypsin activity and thereby protects against chronic pancreatitis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {L-asparaginase is an important drug in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Treatment is associated with several toxicities, including acute pancreatitis. Clinical course, presentation, re-exposure to L-asparginase after pancreatitis and risk of recurrent pancreatitis within an asparaginase-intensive protocol has been poorly reported. Children (1-17 years) on the ongoing Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol with asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) diagnosed between 2008 and 2012 were identified through the online NOPHO ALL toxicity registry. NOPHO ALL2008 includes eight or 15 doses of intramuscular pegylated L-asparginase (PEG-asparaginase) 1000 iu/m2/dose at 2-6 weeks intervals, with a total of 30 weeks of exposure to PEG-asparaginase (clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT00819351). Of 786 children, 45 were diagnosed with AAP with a cumulative risk of AAP of 5{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}. AAP occurred after a median of five doses (range 1-13), and 11 d (median) from the latest administration of PEG-Asparaginase. Thirteen patients developed pseudocysts (30{\%}) and 11 patients developed necrosis (25{\%}). One patient died from pancreatitis. Twelve AAP patients were re-exposed to L-asparginase, two of whom developed mild AAP once more, after four and six doses respectively. In conclusion, re-exposure to PEG-asparaginase in ALL patients with mild AAP seems safe. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: L-asparaginase is a universal component of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and is usually administered intramuscularly. Pegylated Escherichia coli asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) has a longer half-life and is potentially less immunogenic than the native Escherichia coli (E coli) preparation, and can be more feasibly administered intravenously. The aim of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Consortium Protocol 05-001 (DFCI 05-001) was to compare the relative toxicity and efficacy of intravenous PEG-asparaginase and intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Methods: DFCI 05-001 enrolled patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia from 11 consortium sites in the USA and Canada. Patients were assigned to an initial risk group on the basis of their baseline characteristics and then underwent 32 days of induction therapy. Those who achieved complete remission after induction therapy were assigned to a final risk group and were eligible to participate in a randomised comparison of intravenous PEG-asparaginase (15 doses of 2500 IU/m2 every 2 weeks) or intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase (30 doses of 25 000 IU/m2 weekly), beginning at week 7 after study entry. Randomisation (1:1) was unmasked, and was done by a statistician-generated allocation sequence using a permuted blocks algorithm (block size of 4), stratified by final risk group. The primary endpoint of the randomised comparison was the overall frequency of asparaginase-related toxicities (defined as allergy, pancreatitis, and thrombotic or bleeding complications). Predefined secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, serum asparaginase activity, and quality of life during therapy as assessed by PedsQL surveys. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00400946. Findings: Between April 22, 2005, and Feb 12, 2010, 551 eligible patients were enrolled. 526 patients achieved complete remission after induction, of whom 463 were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase (n=231) or intravenous PEG-asparaginase (n=232). The two treatment groups did not differ significantly in the overall frequency of asparaginase-related toxicities (65 [28{\%}] of 232 patients in the intravenous PEG-asparaginase group vs 59 [26{\%}] of 231 patients in the intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase group, p=0{\textperiodcentered}60), or in the individual frequency of allergy (p=0{\textperiodcentered}36), pancreatitis (p=0{\textperiodcentered}55), or thrombotic or bleeding complications (p=0{\textperiodcentered}26). Median follow-up was 6{\textperiodcentered}0 years (IQR 5{\textperiodcentered}0-7{\textperiodcentered}1). 5-year disease-free survival was 90{\%} (95{\%} CI 86-94) for patients assigned to intravenous PEG-asparaginase and 89{\%} (85-93) for those assigned to intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase (p=0{\textperiodcentered}58). The median nadir serum asparaginase activity was significantly higher in patients who received intravenous PEG-asparaginase than in those who received intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase. Significantly more anxiety was reported by both patients and parent-proxy in the intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase group than in the intravenous PEG-asparaginase group. Scores for other domains were similar between the groups. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were bacterial or fungal infections (47 [20{\%}] of 232 in the intravenous PEG-asparaginase group vs 51 [22{\%}] of 231 patients in the intramuscular E coli L-asparaginase group) and asparaginase-related allergic reactions (14 [6{\%}] vs 6 [3{\%}]). Interpretation: Intravenous PEG-asparaginase was not more toxic than, was similarly efficacious to, and was associated with decreased anxiety compared with intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase, supporting its use as the front-line asparaginase preparation in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

abstract = {Anticancer cytotoxic agents go through a process by which their antitumor activity - on the basis of the amount of tumor shrinkage they could generate - has been investigated. In the late 1970s, the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization introduced specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. In 1994, several organizations involved in clinical research combined forces to tackle the review of these criteria on the basis of the experience and knowledge acquired since then. After several years of intensive discussions, a new set of guidelines is ready that will supersede the former criteria. In parallel to this initiative, one of the participating groups developed a model by which response rates could be derived from unidimensional measurement of tumor lesions instead of the usual bidimensional approach. This new concept has been largely validated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group and integrated into the present guidelines. This special article also provides some philosophic background to clarify the various purposes of response evaluation. It proposes a model by which a combined assessment of all existing lesions, characterized by target lesions (to be measured) and nontarget lesions, is used to extrapolate an overall response to treatment. Methods of assessing tumor lesions are better codified, briefly within the guidelines and in more detail in Appendix I. All other aspects of response evaluation have been discussed, reviewed, and amended whenever appropriate.},

To address this, our lab had developed a novel level set segmentation algorithm that is 16× faster and {\textgreater}96{\%} accurate on realistic brain phantoms. Methods: This study reports speed, precision and estimated accuracy of our algorithm when measuring MRIs of meningioma brain tumors and compares it to manual tracing and modified MacDonald (MM) ellipsoid criteria. A repeated-measures study allowed us to determine measurement precisions (MPs) - clinically relevant thresholds for statistically significant change. Results: Speed: the level set, MM, and trace methods required 1:20, 1:35, and 9:35 (mm:ss) respectively on average to complete a volume measurement (p{\textless}0.05). Accuracy: the level set was not statistically different to the estimated true lesion volumes (p{\textgreater}0.05). Precision: the MM's within-operator and between-operator MPs were significantly higher (worse) than the other methods (p{\textless}0.05). The observed difference in MP between the level set and trace methods did not reach statistical significance (p{\textgreater}0.05).

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Reproducible segmentation of brain tumors on magnetic resonance images is an important clinical need. This study was designed to evaluate the reliability of a novel fully automated segmentation tool for brain tumor image analysis in comparison to manually defined tumor segmentations. Methods: We prospectively evaluated preoperative MR Images from 25 glioblastoma patients. Two independent expert raters performed manual segmentations. Automatic segmentations were performed using the Brain Tumor Image Analysis software (BraTumIA). In order to study the different tumor compartments, the complete tumor volume TV (enhancing part plus non-enhancing part plus necrotic core of the tumor), the TV+ (TV plus edema) and the contrast enhancing tumor volume CETV were identified. We quantified the overlap between manual and automated segmentation by calculation of diameter measurements as well as the Dice coefficients, the positive predictive values, sensitivity, relative volume error and absolute volume error. Results: Comparison of automated versus manual extraction of 2-dimensional diameter measurements showed no significant difference (p = 0.29). Comparison of automated versus manual segmentation of volumetric segmentations showed significant differences for TV+ and TV (p{\textless}0.05) but no significant differences for CETV (p{\textgreater}0.05) with regard to the Dice overlap coefficients. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (r) of TV+, TV and CETV showed highly significant correlations between automatic and manual segmentations. Tumor localization did not influence the accuracy of segmentation. Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrated that BraTumIA supports radiologists and clinicians by providing accurate measures of cross-sectional diameter-based tumor extensions. The automated volume measurements were comparable to manual tumor delineation for CETV tumor volumes, and outperformed inter-rater variability for overlap and sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Porz et al.},

We evaluated a fully automatic MR-based segmentation method by comparing it to manually defined sub-volumes by experienced radiologists in the TCGA-GBM dataset, in terms of sub-volume prognosis and association with VASARI features. MRI sets of 109 GBM patients were downloaded from the Cancer Imaging archive. GBM sub-compartments were defined manually and automatically using the Brain Tumor Image Analysis (BraTumIA). Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate the agreement with VASARI features. Prognostic significance was assessed using the C-index. Auto-segmented sub-volumes showed moderate to high agreement with manually delineated volumes (range (r): 0.4 - 0.86). Also, the auto and manual volumes showed similar correlation with VASARI features (auto r=0.35, 0.43 and 0.36; manual r=0.17, 0.67, 0.41, for contrast-enhancing, necrosis and edema, respectively). The auto-segmented contrast-enhancing volume and post-contrast abnormal volume showed the highest AUC (0.66, CI: 0.55-0.77 and 0.65, CI: 0.54-0.76), comparable to manually defined volumes (0.64, CI: 0.53-0.75 and 0.63, CI: 0.52-0.74, respectively). BraTumIA and manual tumor sub-compartments showed comparable performance in terms of prognosis and correlation with VASARI features. This method can enable more reproducible definition and quantification of imaging based biomarkers and has potential in high-throughput medical imaging research.},

This study's objective was to determine the accuracy and reliability of the widely used volume measurement method ABC/2 in estimating EDHV by comparing it to the computer-assisted planimetric method. Methods: A data set of computerized tomography (CT) scans of 35 patients with EDH was evaluated to determine the accuracy of ABC/2 method, using computer-assisted planimetric technique to establish the reference criterion of EDHV for each patient. Another data set was constructed by randomly selecting 5 patients then replicating each case twice to yield 15 patients. Intra- and interobserver reliability were evaluated by asking four observers to independently estimate EDHV for the latter data set using the ABC/2 method. Results: Estimation of EDHV using the ABC/2 method showed high intra- and interobserver reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient =.99). These estimates were closely correlated with planimetric measures (r =.99). But the ABC/2 method generally overestimated EDHV, especially in the nonellipsoid-like group. The difference between the ABC/2 measures and planimetric measures was statistically significant (p {\textless}.05). Conclusions: The ABC/2 method could be used for EDHV measurement, which would contribute to treatment decision making as well as clinical outcome prediction. However, clinicians should be aware that the ABC/2 method results in a general volume overestimation. Future studies focusing on justification of the technique to improve its accuracy would be of practical value.},

abstract = {Automatic brain tumour segmentation has become a key component for the future of brain tumour treatment. Currently, most of brain tumour segmentation approaches arise from the supervised learning standpoint, which requires a labelled training dataset from which to infer the models of the classes. The performance of these models is directly determined by the size and quality of the training corpus, whose retrieval becomes a tedious and time-consuming task. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches avoid these limitations but often do not reach comparable results than the supervised methods. In this sense, we propose an automated unsupervised method for brain tumour segmentation based on anatomical Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. Four unsupervised classification algorithms, grouped by their structured or non-structured condition, were evaluated within our pipeline. Considering the non-structured algorithms, we evaluated K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whereas as structured classification algorithms we evaluated Gaussian Hidden Markov Random Field (GHMRF). An automated postprocess based on a statistical approach supported by tissue probability maps is proposed to automatically identify the tumour classes after the segmentations. We evaluated our brain tumour segmentation method with the public BRAin Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) 2013 Test and Leaderboard datasets. Our approach based on the GMM model improves the results obtained by most of the supervised methods evaluated with the Leaderboard set and reaches the second position in the ranking. Our variant based on the GHMRF achieves the first position in the Test ranking of the unsupervised approaches and the seventh position in the general Test ranking, which confirms the method as a viable alternative for brain tumour segmentation.},

abstract = {Accurate and repeatable measurement of the gross tumour volume(GTV) of subcutaneous xenografts is crucial in the evaluation of anti-tumour therapy. Formula and image-based manual segmentation methods are commonly used for GTV measurement but are hindered by low accuracy and reproducibility. 3D Slicer is open-source software that provides semiautomatic segmentation for GTV measurements. In our study, subcutaneous GTVs from nude mouse xenografts were measured by semiautomatic segmentation with 3D Slicer based on morphological magnetic resonance imaging(mMRI) or diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI)(b=0,20,800s/mm 2). These GTVs were then compared with those obtained via the formula and image-based manual segmentation methods with ITK software using the true tumour volume as the standard reference. The effects of tumour size and shape on GTVs measurements were also investigated. Our results showed that, when compared with the true tumour volume, segmentation for DWI(P=0.060-0.671) resulted in better accuracy than that mMRI(P{\textless}0.001) and the formula method(P{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, semiautomatic segmentation for DWI(intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.9999) resulted in higher reliability than manual segmentation(ICC=0.9996-0.9998). Tumour size and shape had no effects on GTV measurement across all methods. Therefore, DWI-based semiautomatic segmentation, which is accurate and reproducible and also provides biological information, is the optimal GTV measurement method in the assessment of anti-tumour treatments.},

abstract = {In this study, we present pituitary adenoma volumetry using the free and open source medical image computing platform for biomedical research: (3D) Slicer. Volumetric changes in cerebral pathologies like pituitary adenomas are a critical factor in treatment decisions by physicians and in general the volume is acquired manually. Therefore, manual slice-by-slice segmentations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which have been obtained at regular intervals, are performed. In contrast to this manual time consuming slice-by-slice segmentation process Slicer is an alternative which can be significantly faster and less user intensive. In this contribution, we compare pure manual segmentations of ten pituitary adenomas with semi-automatic segmentations under Slicer. Thus, physicians drew the boundaries completely manually on a slice-by-slice basis and performed a Slicer-enhanced segmentation using the competitive region-growing based module of Slicer named GrowCut. Results showed that the time and user effort required for GrowCut-based segmentations were on average about thirty percent less than the pure manual segmentations. Furthermore, we calculated the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) between the manual and the Slicer-based segmentations to proof that the two are comparable yielding an average DSC of 81.97±3.39{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Egger et al.},

Typically, the tumor volume is computed on a slice-by-slice basis using MRI scans obtained at regular intervals. (3D)Slicer-a free platform for biomedical research-provides an alternative to this manual slice-by-slice segmentation process, which is significantly faster and requires less user interaction. In this study, 4 physicians segmented GBMs in 10 patients, once using the competitive region-growing based GrowCut segmentation module of Slicer, and once purely by drawing boundaries completely manually on a slice-by-slice basis. Furthermore, we provide a variability analysis for three physicians for 12 GBMs. The time required for GrowCut segmentation was on an average 61{\%} of the time required for a pure manual segmentation. A comparison of Slicer-based segmentation with manual slice-by-slice segmentation resulted in a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 88.43 ± 5.23{\%} and a Hausdorff Distance of 2.32 ± 5.23 ± mm.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to investigate factors affecting response to everolimus, a mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Methods: The study group consisted of 15 children with a diagnosis of TSC-related SEGA. Median therapy duration was 13 months. Age, sex, previous neurosurgical or mTOR inhibitor treatment, everolimus blood concentration and anticonvulsant therapy were analyzed as potential factors affecting reduction of SEGA tumor volume. Results: Significant reductions in SEGA volumes were noted at 3 and 6 months (median tumor volume 0.97 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 0.70 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively, versus 2.70 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at baseline, P=0.001). Responses were observed in 11/15 (73.3{\%}) and 10/12 (83.3{\%}) patients at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The most rapid reduction of SEGA volume (58.6{\%}) was found during the initial 3 months of treatment. There was no statistical difference in the extent of SEGA volume reduction between patients with everolimus trough levels {\textless}5 ng/ml and ≥5 ng/ml. Patients treated with ≤1 anticonvulsant had greater tumor reduction after 6 months of treatment. Conclusions: Everolimus is an effective and safe treatment option for TSC-related SEGA. Drug dose titration according to blood concentration did not appear to be crucial to achieve clinical efficacy; however, concomitant anticonvulsant therapy may affect response to mTOR inhibitors.

abstract = {Objective: To report long-term efficacy and safety data for everolimus for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Methods: This was an open-label extension phase of a prospective, phase 1-2 trial (NCT00411619) in patients ≥3 years of agewith SEGA associatedwith TSC. Patients received oral everolimus starting at 3 mg/m2 per day and subsequently titrated, subject to tolerability, to attain whole blood trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. Change in SEGA volume, seizures, and safety assessments were the main outcome measures. Results: Of 28 patients enrolled, 25 were still under treatment at the time of analysis. Median dose was 5.3 mg/m2/day and median treatment duration was 34.2 months (range 4.7-47.1). At all time points (18, 24, 30, and 36 months), primary SEGA volume was reduced by ≥30{\%} from baseline (treatment response) in 65{\%}-79{\%} of patients. All patients reported ≥1 adverse event (AE), mostly grade 1/2 in severity, consistent with that previously reported, and none led to everolimus discontinuation. The most commonly reported drug-related AEs were upper respiratory infections (85.7{\%}), stomatitis (85.7{\%}), sinusitis (46.4{\%}), and otitis media (35.7{\%}). No drug-related grade 4 or 5 events occurred. Conclusion: Everolimus therapy is safe and effective for longer term (median exposure 34.2 months) treatment of patients with TSC with SEGA. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that everolimus, titrated to trough serum levels of 5-15 ng/mL, was effective in reducing tumor size in patients with SEGA secondary to TSC for a median of 34 months. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract = {Background: Currently, we are not aware of a method to assess graphically on one simple plot agreement between more than two observers making continuous measurements on the same subjects. Methods: We aimed to develop a simple graphical method to assess agreement between multiple observers using continuous measurements. The Bland-Altman graphical method for assessing agreement between two observers using continuous measures was modified and extended to accommodate multiple observers. Mathematical formulae are derived and real data examples used to illustrate the proposed method. Results: The examples show that the proposed graphical method of assessing agreement provides clinically useful information. This information includes estimates of the limits of agreement with the mean and a visual means for determining these limits over the range of measurements. In a data example that included five readers' measurements of 40 lung lesions, the intra-class correlation (ICC) was 0.84 indicating readers can reliably measure the lesions. However, the estimated limits of agreement with the mean were -1.1 to 1.1 cm implying that the readers' measurements can plausibly differ from the mean estimated tumour size by more than 1 cm. This is a clinically significant difference according to the study authors. In addition, a plot of the limits of agreement with the mean by mean tumour size shows heterogeneous agreement presumably due to the varying degrees of definition at the edge of the lesions. Conclusions The proposed graphical method of assessing agreement can be used alongside other measures such as ICC for reporting on reproducibility in studies of multiple observers making continuous measurements. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011; all rights reserved.},

The 95{\%} limits of agreement, estimated by mean difference ± 1.96 standard deviation of the differences, provide an interval within which 95{\%} of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie. We describe how graphical methods can be used to investigate the assumptions of the method and we also give confidence intervals. We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

abstract = {Multimodal approaches that combine near-infrared (NIR) and conventional imaging modalities have been shown to improve optical parameter estimation dramatically and thus represent a prevailing trend in NIR imaging. These approaches typically involve applying anatomical templates from magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography/ultrasound images to guide the recovery of optical parameters. However, merging these data sets using current technology requires multiple software packages, substantial expertise, significant time-commitment, and often results in unacceptably poor mesh quality for optical image reconstruction, a reality that represents a significant roadblock for translational research of multimodal NIR imaging. This work addresses these challenges directly by introducing automated digital imaging and communications in medicine image stack segmentation and a new one-click three-dimensional mesh generator optimized for multimodal NIR imaging, and combining these capabilities into a single software package (available for free download) with a streamlined workflow. Image processing time and mesh quality benchmarks were examined for four common multimodal NIR use-cases (breast, brain, pancreas, and small animal) and were compared to a commercial image processing package. Applying these tools resulted in a fivefold decrease in image processing time and 62{\%} improvement in minimum mesh quality, in the absence of extra mesh postprocessing. These capabilities represent a significant step toward enabling translational multimodal NIR research for both expert and nonexpert users in an open-source platform.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside.3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Much work has been carried out for accurate modeling and image reconstruction from clinical data. NIRFAST, a modeling and image reconstruction package has been developed, which is capable of single wavelength and multi-wavelength optical or functional imaging from measured data. The theory behind the modeling techniques as well as the image reconstruction algorithms is presented here, and 2D and 3D examples are presented to demonstrate its capabilities. The results show that 3D modeling can be combined with measured data from multiple wavelengths to reconstruct chromophore concentrations within the tissue. Additionally it is possible to recover scattering spectra, resulting from the dominant Mie-type scatter present in tissue. Overall, this paper gives a comprehensive over view of the modeling techniques used in diffuse optical tomographic imaging, in the context of NIRFAST software package.

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients - manually annotated by up to four raters - and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74{\%}-85{\%}), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

abstract = {Objective To analyze the cumulative efficacy and safety of everolimus in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) from an open-label phase II study (NCT00411619). Updated data became available from the conclusion of the extension phase and are presented in this ≥5-year analysis. Methods Patients aged ≥ 3 years with a definite diagnosis of TSC and increasing SEGA lesion size (≥2 magnetic resonance imaging scans) received everolimus starting at 3mg/m2/day (titrated to target blood trough levels of 5-15ng/ml). The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction from baseline in primary SEGA volume. Results As of the study completion date (January 28, 2014), 22 of 28 (78.6{\%}) initially enrolled patients finished the study per protocol. Median (range) duration of exposure to everolimus was 67.8 (4.7-83.2) months; 12 (52.2{\%}) and 14 (60.9{\%}) of 23 patients experienced SEGA volume reductions of ≥50{\%} and ≥30{\%} relative to baseline, respectively, after 60 months of treatment. The proportion of patients experiencing daily seizures was reduced from 7 of 26 (26.9{\%}) patients at baseline to 2 of 18 (11.1{\%}) patients at month 60. Most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were upper respiratory tract infection and stomatitis of mostly grade 1 or 2 severity. No patient discontinued treatment due to AEs. The frequency of emergence of most AEs decreased over the course of the study. Interpretation Everolimus continues to demonstrate a sustained effect on SEGA tumor reduction over ≥5 years of treatment. Everolimus remained well-tolerated, and no new safety concerns were noted.},

abstract = {Background: Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: both tumour shrinkage (objective response) and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials. Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse ({\textgreater}6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews. Highlights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions to be assessed: based on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of five total (and from five to two per organ, maximum). Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes with a short axis of ≥15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to {\textless}10 mm short axis are considered normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20{\%} increase in sum, a 5 mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression' of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions. Future work: A key question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or MRI. It was concluded that, at present, there is not sufficient standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of tumour burden. The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression. As is detailed in the final paper in this special issue, the use of these promising newer approaches requires appropriate clinical validation studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is associated with hamartomatous growths including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Although, SEGAs are slow-growing glioneuronal tumors, they represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality due to the risk of sudden death from acute hydrocephalus. Neurosurgical resection has been the mainstay of therapy, since radiotherapy and chemotherapy were proved inefficient in those tumors. Recent studies support the use of everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis and suggest it might represent a disease-modifying treatment for other aspects of tuberous sclerosis. Methods: We describe the clinical and radiological progression of three pediatric patients with definitive diagnosis of TSC and SEGA, which have been treated with everolimus. Results: Up to 34 {\%} sustained SEGA decrease was observed in the three cases. All three patients have experienced seizure control and two of them have showed cognitive and behavioral improvement. Everolimus has been well tolerated by all. No severe adverse events have been observed to date. Conclusion: Everolimus offers significant promise in treating SEGAs. Studies are required to explore optimal therapy duration and management upon discontinuing therapy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a type of brain tumour that develops in 10-15{\%} of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). SEGAs can be unilateral or bilateral, developing from benign subependymal nodules (hamartomas) located near the foramen of Monro. These are usually slow-growing, glialneuronal tumours that develop within the first 2 decades of life. Traditionally, the management of SEGA involved monitoring using periodic neuroimaging, and surgical resection of tumours that exhibited growth and/or caused clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. Recent clinical research has demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can induce partial regression of SEGA associated with TSC and so might provide an acceptable alternative to neurosurgery for these tumours. This report summarizes the clinical recommendations for the management of SEGA made by a panel of European experts in March 2012. Current treatment options and outstanding questions are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study is to develop, deploy and evaluate an interactive application for Windows and Android operating systems, which could serve as a digital diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for the patient and the doctor. The software is gathering details about patients' diet and associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals, specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a major public health challenge and present a therapeutic imperative for which we need additional insight into molecular pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Because APOE locus variants contribute to risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and to differences in age at onset (AAO), it is important to know whether other established LOAD risk loci also affect AAO in affected participants. OBJECTIVES To investigate the effects of known Alzheimer disease risk loci in modifying AAO and to estimate their cumulative effect on AAO variation using data from genome-wide association studies in the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium comprises 14 case-control, prospective, and family-based data sets with data on 9162 participants of white race/ethnicity with Alzheimer disease occurring after age 60 years who also had complete AAO information, gathered between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites by participating studies. Data on genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms most significantly associated with risk at 10 confirmed LOAD loci were examined in linear modeling of AAO, and individual data set results were combined using a random-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis approach to determine whether they contribute to variation in AAO. Aggregate effects of all risk loci on AAO were examined in a burden analysis using genotype scores weighted by risk effect sizes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age at disease onset abstracted from medical records among participants with LOAD diagnosed per standard criteria. RESULTS: Analysis confirmed the association of APOE with earlier AAO (P = 3.3 × 10-96), with associations in CR1 (rs6701713, P = 7.2 × 10-4), BIN1 (rs7561528, P = 4.8 × 10-4), and PICALM (rs561655, P = 2.2 × 10-3) reaching statistical significance (P {\textless} .005). Risk alleles individually reduced AAO by 3 to 6 months. Burden analyses demonstrated that APOE contributes to 3.7{\%}of the variation in AAO (R2 = 0.256) over baseline (R2 = 0.221), whereas the other 9 loci together contribute to 2.2{\%}of the variation (R2 = 0.242). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We confirmed an association of APOE (OMIM 107741) variants with AAO among affected participants with LOAD and observed novel associations of CR1 (OMIM 120620), BIN1 (OMIM 601248), and PICALM (OMIM 603025) with AAO. In contrast to earlier hypothetical modeling, we show that the combined effects of Alzheimer disease risk variants on AAO are on the scale of, but do not exceed, the APOE effect. While the aggregate effects of risk loci on AAO may be significant, additional genetic contributions to AAO are individually likely to be small.},

abstract = {To identify common variants contributing to normal variation in two specific domains of cognitive functioning, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of executive functioning and information processing speed in non-demented older adults from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium. Neuropsychological testing was available for 5429-32 070 subjects of European ancestry aged 45 years or older, free of dementia and clinical stroke at the time of cognitive testing from 20 cohorts in the discovery phase. We analyzed performance on the Trail Making Test parts A and B, the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), semantic and phonemic fluency tests, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 × 10 -8) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 × 10 -9 after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 × 10 -4). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 × 10 -15), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 × 10 -11) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 × 10 -13). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the CADM2 gene is associated with individual differences in information processing speed.},

abstract = {Background. We aimed to derive three-dimensional volume-based (V3D) response criteria that approximate those based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) in patients with brain metastases (BM) treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Material and methods. Seventy patients with 178 BM were treated with SRS. Each BM was characterised at baseline and at each follow-up MRI according to its widest diameter and V3D using ITK-SNAP image segmentation software. Results. The median tumour diameter was 1.2 cm (range, 0.2-4.5 cm) and V3D was 0.73 cm 3 (range, 0.01-22.7 cm 3). The V 3D percent changes that best matched RECIST response criteria were: an increase of ≥71.5{\%} for progressive disease, a ≥58.5{\%} decrease for partial response and a {\textless}58.5{\%} decrease or increase of {\textless}71.5{\%} for stable disease (k = 0.85). A baseline diameter {\textgreater}3.0 cm (p = 0.006) and a V 3D {\textgreater}6.0 cm 3 (p = 0.043) predicted for local failure, and a baseline cumulative V 3D of {\textgreater}3.0 cm 3 (p = 0.02) was adversely prognostic for survival. Conclusions. We define 3D volume specific criteria to base response upon for brain metastases treated with salvage SRS. Tumours with a V 3D of greater than 6 cm 3 are at a higher risk of local failure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract = {The efficient extraction of the cryoablation iceball from a time series of 3D images is crucial during cryoablation to assist the interventionalist in determining the coverage of the tumor by the ablated volume. Conventional semi-automatic segmentation tools such as ITK-SNAP and 3D Slicer's Fast Marching Segmentation can attain accurate iceball segmentation in retrospective studies, however, they are not ideal for intraprocedure real time segmentation, as they require time-consuming manual operations, such as the input of fiducials and the extent of the segmented region growth. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for the segmentation of the iceball during cryoablation, that executes a fully automatic computation. Our approach is based on the graph cuts segmentation framework, and incorporates prior information of iceball shape evolving in time, modeled using experimentally-derived iceball growth parameters. Modeling yields a shape prior mask image at each timepoint of the imaging time series for use in the segmentation. Segmentation results of our method and the ITK-SNAP method are compared for 8 timepoints in 2 cases. The results indicate that our fully automatic approach is accurate, robust and highly efficient compared to manual and semi-automatic approaches. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Objective:A substantial number of children exposed to gestational opioids have neurodevelopmental, behavioral and cognitive problems. Opioids are not neuroteratogens but whether they affect the developing brain in more subtle ways (for example, volume loss) is unclear. We aimed to determine the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess volumetric changes in healthy opioid-exposed infants.Study design:Observational pilot cohort study conducted in two maternity hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Maternal history and neonatal urine and meconium screens were obtained to confirm drug exposure. Volumetric analysis of MRI scans was performed with the ITK-snap program.Result:Scans for 16 infants (mean (s.d.) gestational age: 40.9 (1.5) weeks, birth weight: 3022.5 (476.6) g, head circumference (HC): 33.7 (1.5 cm)) were analyzed. Six (37.5{\%}) infants had HC {\textless}25th percentile. Fourteen mothers used methadone, four used buprenorphine and 11 used more than one opioid (including heroin, seven). All scans were structurally normal whole brain volumes (357.4 (63.8)) and basal ganglia (14.5 (3.5)) ml were significantly smaller than population means (425.4 (4.8), 17.1 (4.4) ml, respectively) but lateral ventricular volumes (3.5 (1.8) ml) were larger than population values (2.1(1.5)) ml.Conclusion:Our pilot study suggests that brain volumes of opioid-exposed babies may be smaller than population means and that specific regions, for example, basal ganglia, that are involved in neurotransmission, may be particularly affected. Larger studies including correlation with neurodevelopmental outcomes are warranted to substantiate this finding.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether pre-treatment growth rate of vestibular schwannomas (VS) predict response to radiosurgery.
Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all VS patients treated with 12Gy prescription dose between September 2005 and June 2011 at our institution using the Leksell Model 4C Gamma Knife Unit was conducted. Patients who had a minimum of 12-months clinical and radiological assessment before and after radiosurgery were included in this study. Tumor growth rates were calculated using specific growth rate (SGR). Tumor volumes were measured on FIESTA-MRI scans using ITK-SNAP v2.2.
Results: Following radiosurgery, twenty-seven (42.9{\%}) patients showed a significant decrease in volume after one year, twenty-nine (46.0{\%}) stabilized, and seven (11.1{\%}) continued to grow. There was no correlation between VS pre-treatment SGRs with post-treatment SGRs (p= 0.34), and incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE). The reduction in tumors' SGRs after radiosurgery was proportional to pre-treatment SGRs, although this correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Analysis of risk factors revealed a positive correlation between post-treatment SGRs and incidence of non-auditory complications, most of which were attributed to ARE (p=0.047).
Conclusion: Pre-treatment growth rate of VS does not predict tumor response to radiosurgery or incidence of ARE. VS with higher SGRs post-radiosurgery are more likely to experience ARE.},

abstract = {Enophthalmos occurs from the increased bony volume or decreased soft tissue volume in the orbit and can be caused in patients with long-term ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. This study tried to find out the change of orbital volume by measuring the orbital volume before and after operation in adult patients who underwent VP shunt for hydrocephalus. The 2 evaluators measured orbital volume by using ITK-SNAP 2.4 program with double-blind test for computed tomography images before and after operation targeting 36 patients over the age of 18 who underwent VP shunt with pressure-controlled valve from 2003 to 2011. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test of GraphPad software was used to statistically analyze the difference in orbital volume change before and after operation. In case of mean pre-op orbital volume of total 36 patients, the right was measured as 23.72 ± 4.65 cm3, the left as 23.47 ± 4.61 cm3, the post-op right as 24.67 ± 4.70 cm3, and the left as 24.18 ± 4.63 cm3, showing no statistically significant difference (P = 0.106). The mean pre-op orbital volume of 14 people (28 eyes) followed for more than 11 months was 25.06 ± 4.58 cm in the right and 24.4 ± 5.02 cm3 in the left and the mean post-op orbital volume was 27.0 ± 4.28 cm3 in the right and 25.76 ± 3.92 cm3 in the left, showing statistically significant differences in the change of the volume before and after shunt operation (P = 0.0057). In patients who maintain long-term shunt devices after VP shunt, remodeling of matured orbital bone may be caused due to the change in pressure gradient between cranial cavity and orbit and the possible occurrence of resulting secondary enophthalmos by increased orbital volume should be considered.},

abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the precision and accuracy of 6 imaging software programs for measuring upper airway volumes in cone-beam computed tomography data. Methods: The sample consisted of 33 growing patients and an oropharynx acrylic phantom, scanned with an i-CAT scanner (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa). The known oropharynx acrylic phantom volume was used as the gold standard. Semi-automatic segmentations with interactive and fixed threshold protocols of the patients' oropharynx and oropharynx acrylic phantom were performed by using Mimics (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium), ITK-Snap (www.itksnap.org), OsiriX (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland), Dolphin3D (Dolphin Imaging {\&} Management Solutions, Chatsworth, Calif), InVivo Dental (Anatomage, San Jose, Calif), and Ondemand3D (CyberMed, Seoul, Korea) software programs. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used for the reliability tests. A repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and post-hoc tests (Bonferroni) were used to compare the software programs. Results: The reliability was high for all programs. With the interactive threshold protocol, the oropharynx acrylic phantom segmentations with Mimics, Dolphin3D, OsiriX, and ITK-Snap showed less than 2{\%} errors in volumes compared with the gold standard. Ondemand3D and InVivo Dental had more than 5{\%} errors compared with the gold standard. With the fixed threshold protocol, the volume errors were similar (-11.1{\%} to -11.7{\%}) among the programs. In the oropharynx segmentation with the interactive protocol, ITK-Snap, Mimics, OsiriX, and Dolphin3D were statistically significantly different (P {\textless}0.05) from InVivo Dental. No statistical difference (P {\textgreater}0.05) was found between InVivo Dental and OnDemand3D. Conclusions: All 6 imaging software programs were reliable but had errors in the volume segmentations of the oropharynx. Mimics, Dolphin3D, ITK-Snap, and OsiriX were similar and more accurate than InVivo Dental and Ondemand3D for upper airway assessment. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Association of Orthodontists.},

Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing.

abstract = {Reproducibility verification is essential to the practice of the scientific method. Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification. This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84{\%} code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads. The median normalized closeness centrality, a measure of knowledge flow, resulting from the distributed peer code review system was high, 0.46. {\textcopyright} 2014 McCormick, Liu, Jomier, Marion and Ibanez.},

abstract = {The incidence of diabetes is escalating worldwide and, consequently, this has become a major health care problem. Moreover, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with significantly accelerated rates of microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular complications such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular and hypertensive diseases. Key factors have been implicated in leading to these complications, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, advanced glycation end products, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and related increases in cellular oxidant stress (including mitochondrial) and endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the high incidence of diabetic complications, which often progress despite glycemic control, are still not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that have elicited immense interest in recent years. They repress target gene expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms and have diverse cellular and biological functions. Herein, we discuss the role of miRNAs in the pathobiology of various diabetic complications, their involvement in oxidant stress, and also the potential use of differentially expressed miRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common life-threatening hereditary disease in the USA. In human ADPKD studies, sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, had little therapeutic effect. While sirolimus robustly inhibits mTORC1, it has a minimal effect on mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Polycystic kidneys of Pkd2WS25/- mice, an orthologous model of human ADPKD caused by a mutation in the Pkd2 gene, had an early increase in pS6 (marker of mTORC1) and pAktSer473 (marker of mTORC2). To investigate the effect of combined mTORC1 and 2 inhibition, Pkd2WS25/- mice were treated with an mTOR anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) that blocks mTOR expression thus inhibiting both mTORC1 and 2. The mTOR ASO resulted in a significant decrease in mTOR protein, pS6 and pAktSer473. Pkd2WS25/- mice treated with the ASO had a normalization of kidney weights and kidney function and a marked decrease in cyst volume. The mTOR ASO resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation and apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. To demonstrate the role of mTORC2 on cyst growth, Rictor, the functional component of mTORC2, was silenced in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cysts grown in 3D cultures. Silencing Rictor significantly decreased cyst volume and expression of pAktSer473. The decreased cyst size in the Rictor silenced cells was reversed by introduction of a constitutively active Akt1. In vitro, combined mTORC1 and 2 inhibition reduced cyst growth more than inhibition of mTORC1 or 2 alone. In conclusion, combined mTORC1 and 2 inhibition has therapeutic potential in ADPKD. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Methods: We profiled miRNAs using RNA isolated from the plasma of participants. The results were validated in 64 MHD patients and 18 healthy controls.
Results: Levels of plasma miR-133a decreased in MHD patients with LVH compared with those in healthy controls. Plasma miR-133a concentrations were negatively correlated with LVMI and IVS. After single hemodialytic treatment, plasma miR- 133a levels remained unchanged. Cardiac Troponin I and T were not associated with LVMI and IVS.

Although PKDs can be caused by mutations in different genes, they converge on a set of common molecular mechanisms involved in cystogenesis and ciliary dysfunction, and can be qualified as ciliopathies. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms regulating disease progression have led to the development of new therapies that are being tested in both preclinical and clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review a network of molecular pathways of cystogenesis that are regulated by ciliary functions. We discuss the mTOR pathway in depth, highlighting recent progress in understanding its role in PKD and the current results of clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Circulating microRNAs are promising new biomarkers of myocardial injury. It is unknown whether levels of microRNAs are affected in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, {\&} measurements High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and cardiac-enriched miR-499 were measured in 41 patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis and 41 controls. Results Levels of hsTnT and miR-499 were highly elevated in patients with ESRD compared with controls ({\textgreater}80-fold increase; P{\textless}0.001). Among patients with ESRD, 98{\%} had positive hsTnT levels and 46{\%} had positive miR-499 levels. Levels of troponins were not affected by hemodialysis. However, miR-499 levels were decreased after hemodialysis (6.5-fold decrease; P=0.002). Conclusions Both miR-499 and troponins are elevated in patients with advanced renal failure. However, whereas levels of troponins are unaffected by hemodialysis, this is not the case for miR-499. Therefore, these observations mitigate the potential of miR-499 as a marker of myocardial injury in patients with ESRD. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control mRNA expression intracellularly and are secreted into the circulation; three miRNAs (miR-125b, miR-145 and miR-155) are known to alter vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and differentiation. We measured these vascular miRNAs in blood from 90 patients with CKD and found decreased circulating levels with progressive loss of eGFR by multivariate analyses. Expression of these vascular miRNAs miR-125b, miR-145, and miR-155 was decreased in the thoracic aorta in CKD rats compared to normal rats, with concordant changes in target genes of RUNX2, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), and myocardin. Furthermore, the expression of miR-155 was negatively correlated with the quantity of calcification in the aorta, a process known to be preceded by vascular de-differentiation in these animals. We then examined the mechanisms of miRNA regulation in primary VSMC and found decreased expression of miR-125b, 145, and 155 in VSMC from rats with CKD compared to normal littermates but no alteration in DROSHA or DICER, indicating that the low levels of expression is not due to altered intracellular processing. Finally, overexpression of miR-155 in VSMC from CKD rats inhibited AT1R expression and decreased cellular proliferation supporting a direct effect of miR-155 on VSMC. In conclusion, we have found ex vivo and in vitro evidence for decreased expression of these vascular miRNA in CKD, suggesting that alterations in miRNAs may lead to the synthetic state of VSMC found in CKD. The decreased levels in the circulation may reflect decreased vascular release but more studies are needed to confirm this relationship.},

abstract = {Background: Circulating microRNAs are stably detectable in serum/plasma and other body fluids. In patients with acute kidney injury on dialysis therapy changes of miRNA patterns had been detected. It remains unclear if and how the dialysis procedure itself affects circulating microRNA level. Methods: We quantified miR-21 and miR-210 by quantitative RT-PCR in plasma of patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and measured pre- and post-dialyser miRNA levels as well as their amount in the collected spent dialysate. Single treatments using the following filters were studied: F60 S (1.3 m 2, Molecular Weight Cut Off (MWCO): 30 kDa, n = 8), AV 1000 S (1.8 m 2, MWCO: 30 kDa, n = 6) and EMiC 2 (1.8 m 2, MWCO: 40 kDa, n = 6). Results: Circulating levels of miR-21 or -210 do not differ between pre- and post-dialyzer blood samples independently of the used filter surface and pore size: miR-21 F60S: p = 0.35, AV 1000 S p = 1.0, EMiC2 p = 1.0; miR-210: F60S: p = 0.91, AV 1000 S p = 0.09, EMiC2 p = 0.31. Correspondingly, only traces of both miRNAs could be found in the collected spent dialysate and ultrafiltrate. Conclusions: In patients with acute kidney injury circulating microRNAs are not removed by dialysis. As only traces of miR-21 and -210 are detected in dialysate and ultrafiltrate, microRNAs in the circulation are likely to be transported by larger structures such as proteins and/or microvesicles. As miRNAs are not affected by dialysis they might be more robust biomarkers of acute kidney injury. {\textcopyright} 2012 Martino et al.},

abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common life-threatening hereditary disease in the USA. In human ADPKD studies, sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, had little therapeutic effect. While sirolimus robustly inhibits mTORC1, it has a minimal effect on mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Polycystic kidneys of Pkd2WS25/- mice, an orthologous model of human ADPKD caused by a mutation in the Pkd2 gene, had an early increase in pS6 (marker of mTORC1) and pAktSer473 (marker of mTORC2). To investigate the effect of combined mTORC1 and 2 inhibition, Pkd2WS25/- mice were treated with an mTOR anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) that blocks mTOR expression thus inhibiting both mTORC1 and 2. The mTOR ASO resulted in a significant decrease in mTOR protein, pS6 and pAktSer473. Pkd2WS25/- mice treated with the ASO had a normalization of kidney weights and kidney function and a marked decrease in cyst volume. The mTOR ASO resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation and apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. To demonstrate the role of mTORC2 on cyst growth, Rictor, the functional component of mTORC2, was silenced in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cysts grown in 3D cultures. Silencing Rictor significantly decreased cyst volume and expression of pAktSer473. The decreased cyst size in the Rictor silenced cells was reversed by introduction of a constitutively active Akt1. In vitro, combined mTORC1 and 2 inhibition reduced cyst growth more than inhibition of mTORC1 or 2 alone. In conclusion, combined mTORC1 and 2 inhibition has therapeutic potential in ADPKD. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The incidence of diabetes is escalating worldwide and, consequently, this has become a major health care problem. Moreover, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with significantly accelerated rates of microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular complications such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular and hypertensive diseases. Key factors have been implicated in leading to these complications, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, advanced glycation end products, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and related increases in cellular oxidant stress (including mitochondrial) and endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the high incidence of diabetic complications, which often progress despite glycemic control, are still not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that have elicited immense interest in recent years. They repress target gene expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms and have diverse cellular and biological functions. Herein, we discuss the role of miRNAs in the pathobiology of various diabetic complications, their involvement in oxidant stress, and also the potential use of differentially expressed miRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Circulating microRNAs are promising new biomarkers of myocardial injury. It is unknown whether levels of microRNAs are affected in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, {\&} measurements High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and cardiac-enriched miR-499 were measured in 41 patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis and 41 controls. Results Levels of hsTnT and miR-499 were highly elevated in patients with ESRD compared with controls ({\textgreater}80-fold increase; P{\textless}0.001). Among patients with ESRD, 98{\%} had positive hsTnT levels and 46{\%} had positive miR-499 levels. Levels of troponins were not affected by hemodialysis. However, miR-499 levels were decreased after hemodialysis (6.5-fold decrease; P=0.002). Conclusions Both miR-499 and troponins are elevated in patients with advanced renal failure. However, whereas levels of troponins are unaffected by hemodialysis, this is not the case for miR-499. Therefore, these observations mitigate the potential of miR-499 as a marker of myocardial injury in patients with ESRD. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology.},

abstract = {Background: Circulating microRNAs are stably detectable in serum/plasma and other body fluids. In patients with acute kidney injury on dialysis therapy changes of miRNA patterns had been detected. It remains unclear if and how the dialysis procedure itself affects circulating microRNA level. Methods: We quantified miR-21 and miR-210 by quantitative RT-PCR in plasma of patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and measured pre- and post-dialyser miRNA levels as well as their amount in the collected spent dialysate. Single treatments using the following filters were studied: F60 S (1.3 m 2, Molecular Weight Cut Off (MWCO): 30 kDa, n = 8), AV 1000 S (1.8 m 2, MWCO: 30 kDa, n = 6) and EMiC 2 (1.8 m 2, MWCO: 40 kDa, n = 6). Results: Circulating levels of miR-21 or -210 do not differ between pre- and post-dialyzer blood samples independently of the used filter surface and pore size: miR-21 F60S: p = 0.35, AV 1000 S p = 1.0, EMiC2 p = 1.0; miR-210: F60S: p = 0.91, AV 1000 S p = 0.09, EMiC2 p = 0.31. Correspondingly, only traces of both miRNAs could be found in the collected spent dialysate and ultrafiltrate. Conclusions: In patients with acute kidney injury circulating microRNAs are not removed by dialysis. As only traces of miR-21 and -210 are detected in dialysate and ultrafiltrate, microRNAs in the circulation are likely to be transported by larger structures such as proteins and/or microvesicles. As miRNAs are not affected by dialysis they might be more robust biomarkers of acute kidney injury. {\textcopyright} 2012 Martino et al.},

abstract = {Objective Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) disfunction is largely due to venous stenosis characterized by a marked amount of intima-media hyperplasia. However, the molecular mechanisms are currently poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, could provide insights into a mechanism for the differential expression of genes in stenotic AVFs. Methods A microarray study was done to detect differences in miRNA levels between stenotic AVF (n = 8) and controls (n = 4). Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays with 12 stenotic AVF veins and eight control veins from predialytic patients were used for verification. Putative gene targets were retrieved from miRNA target prediction databases. Networks from the target gene set were created and examined. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed to confirm the bioinformatic findings. Results A microarray study identified 33 miRNAs with markedly different expression levels between stenotic AVFs and control veins. Among them, nine miRNAs were upregulated and 24 miRNAs were downregulated in the stenotic AVFs. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed statistically consistent expression of six selected miRNAs with microarray analysis. The predicted miRNA target genes differentially expressed in stenotic AVF based on databases were identified. The mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway might be regulated by miRNAs according to bioinformatic analyses and further confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Conclusions Our genome-wide approach identified several differentially expressed miRNAs in stenotic AVFs. This study also suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway might play a role in the pathogenesis of stenotic AVF.},

abstract = {The long-term effect of two surgical techniques for repair of coarctation of the aorta in infancy, namely, resection and end-to-end anastomosis (RETE) and subclavian flap angioplasty (SFA) on the blood supply of the upper left limb, was quantified by Doppler spectrum analysis of blood flow velocities in the left branchial artery at rest and during postocclusive reactive hyperemia. Twenty-three patients participated in this study: nine patients after SFA (median age, 8 years), 14 patients after RETE (median age, 8 years), and 10 control subjects (median age, 9.5 years). At rest, a highly significant decrease of blood flow velocities in the left brachial artery was measured in all patients of the SFA group compared with those of the RETE and control groups, as documented by various Doppler spectrum parameters: maximal frequency of advancing curve (p = 0.0001), pulsatility index (p = 0.0005), and resistance index (p = 0.039). During reactive hyperemia, a moderate capacity of physiologic augmentation of blood flow velocities was observed in five patients of the SFA group. This capacity was marginal in two patients with complaints of claudication in the left upper limb during strenuous exercise, which can be related to the number of branches of the left subclavian artery ligated during operation. This study indicates that SFA in infancy may lead to compromised hemodynamics of the upper left limb with potential for symptoms of ischemia during exercise.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition has been employed in a myriad of industrial, commercial and academic applications. Many techniques have been devised to tackle such a diversity of applications. Despite the long tradition of pattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best classification in all scenarios. Therefore, as many techniques as possible should be considered in high accuracy applications. Typical related works either focus on the performance of a given algorithm or compare various classification methods. In many occasions, however, researchers who are not experts in the field of machine learning have to deal with practical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the underlying parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of classifiers and parameters in such practical circumstances constitutes a long-standing problem and is one of the subjects of the current paper. We carried out a performance study of nine well-known classifiers implemented in the Weka framework and compared the influence of the parameter configurations on the accuracy. The default configuration of parameters in Weka was found to provide near optimal performance for most cases, not including methods such as the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, the k-nearest neighbor method frequently allowed the best accuracy. In certain conditions, it was possible to improve the quality of SVM by more than 20{\%} with respect to their default parameter configuration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Amancio et al.},

Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier's evaluation (measure invariance).

Predicting the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes is one of the challenging problems in computational and molecular biology. In this work, we related sequence features of protein-protein complexes with their binding affinities using machine learning approaches. We set up a database of 185 protein-protein complexes for which the interacting pairs are heterodimers and their experimental binding affinities are available. On the other hand, we have developed a set of 610 features from the sequences of protein complexes and utilized Ranker search method, which is the combination of Attribute evaluator and Ranker method for selecting specific features. We have analyzed several machine learning algorithms to discriminate protein-protein complexes into high and low affinity groups based on their Kd values. Our results showed a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 76.1{\%} with the combination of nine features using support vector machines. Further, we observed accuracy of 83.3{\%} on an independent test set of 30 complexes.

The authors also review the different types of SVM applications in drug discovery, looking at particular case studies. Furthermore, the authors discuss the recent hybrid methods developed that incorporate SVM modeling in different ways. Expert opinion: SVMs are currently among the best-performing approaches for chemical and biological property prediction and the computational identification of active compounds. It is anticipated that their use in drug discovery will further increase. Indeed, this will also include the development of SVM-based meta-classifiers that combine different approaches and exploit their individual strengths and complementarity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.},

This selective review highlights a popular group of pattern recognition techniques, support vector machines (SVMs) for use with structural magnetic resonance imaging scans.

The purpose of this study was to determine the precise anatomy of the nerve and of its branches, and some morphologic features for each segment. Thirty-two shoulders from embalmed adult cadavers have been studied. The axillary n. was divided in five segments: 1) from its origin to the inferior border of the subscapularis m., 2) from the subscapularis m. to the anterolateral border of the tendon of the long head of the triceps brachii m., 3) from the triceps to the posteromedial part of the surgical neck of the humerus, 4) from the humerus to the entry into the deltoid m., 5) the intramuscular distribution of the nerve in the deltoid m. In each segment from 1 to 4 were noted the origins of the branches to the subscapularis and teres minor mm. and to the scapulohumeral joint, and the origins of the lateral cutaneous branchial n. and of the terminal motor branches to the deltoid m. The length and the diameter of the nerve in the segments and the distance from the segment S1 to the musculotendinous junction of the subscapularis m. were measured. The results showed that the mean diameters were about 4.1 mm in segment 1, 4.1 mm in segment 2 and 3.4 mm in segment 3. The mean distance to the musculotendinous junction was 7.7 mm. Many variations in the levels of origin of the different muscular, articular or cutaneous branches were found without symmetry between the right and left sides. The lateral cutaneous brachial n. was absent in four cases. The results are compared with those in the literature. The division into five segments is proposed to radiologists and surgeons for evaluation or operative procedures on the axillary n., and to provide a hypothesis about the variable aspects of injuries of the nerve.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For purposes of neurotization of the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) with the medial pectoral nerve (MPN) after upper trunk brachial plexus injuries, the anatomic relationship between these two nerves was defined in a cadaveric model. METHODS: Thirty-five brachial plexuses in 18 adult cadavers were dissected. The distance between the origin of the MPN from the medial cord to the origin of the MCN from the lateral cord was measured. The length, diameter, branching, and location of the MPN were recorded. The diameter of the proximal MCN was recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of the MPNs, when detached from the pectoralis muscles, were too short to reach the proximal MCN by a mean distance of 15 mm. The MPN pierced the pectoralis minor muscle in 80{\%} of the dissections. The cross sectional area of the MCN was always larger than the cross sectional area of the MPN by an average factor of 2.5. CONCLUSION: When planning to use the MPN for neurotization of the MCN, one should be prepared to harvest an interposition graft, because over one-third of MPNs may not have enough length to reach the MCN in a tension-free manner. Diameter mismatch occurs predictably between the distal MPN and the proximal MCN.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the normal morphometric landmarks of the uniting and dividing points of the brachial plexus (BP) in the periclavicular region to provide useful guidance in surgery of BP injuries. Methods: A total of 20 brachial plexuses were obtained from 10 adult, formalin-fixed cadavers. Distances were measured on the basis of the Chassaignac tubercle (CT), and the most lateral margin of the BP (LMBP) crossing the superior and inferior edge of the clavicle. Results: LMBP was located within 25 mm medially from the midpoint in all subjects. In the supraclavicular region, the upper trunk uniting at 21 ± 7 mm from the CT, separating into divisions at 42 ± 5 mm from the CT, and dividing at 19 ± 4 mm from the LMBP crossing the superior edge of the clavicle. In the infraclavicular region, the distance from the inferior edge of the clavicle to the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) origin was 49 ± 12 mm, to the median nerve origin 57 ± 7 mm, and the ulnar nerve origin 48 ± 6 mm. From the lateral margin of the pectoralis minor to the MCN origin the distance averaged 3.3 ± 10 mm. Mean diameter of the MCN was 4.3 ± 1.1 mm (range, 2.5-6.0) in males (n = 6), and 3.1 ± 1.5 mm (range, 1.6-4.0) in females (n = 4).

abstract = {Purpose: We conducted an anatomic study to provide detailed information on the pectoral nerves and anatomic data on the transfer of the pectoral nerves to the axillary nerve. Moreover, we experimentally determined the feasibility of transferring the pectoral nerves to the suprascapular nerve in upper brachial plexus injury. Methods: We dissected 26 brachial plexus from 15 fresh cadavers. The origin, location, course, and branching of the pectoral nerves were recorded. The length and the diameter of the pectoral nerves were measured. The diameter of the suprascapular and axillary nerves was recorded. In all dissections, we assessed the feasibility of directly transferring the pectoral nerves to the suprascapular and axillary nerves. Results: We found 3 constant branches of pectoral nerves arising from 3 distinct origins in 20 cases, and 3 constant branches arising from 2 distinct origins in 6 cases. The C7 sent nerve fibers to all 3 branches. The average length and diameter of the superior, middle, and inferior branches of the pectoral nerves were 65 mm, 110 mm, and 105 mm, and 2.0 mm, 2.3 mm, ad 2.4 mm, respectively. The average diameter of the suprascapular and axillary were 2.8 mm and 3.6 mm, respectively. The superior branch reached the suprascapular and axillary nerves in 17 and 8 cases. The middle and inferior branches reached the suprascapular and axillary nerve in all dissections. Conclusions: With an adequate length, diameter, and nerve composition, the middle and inferior branches of the pectoral nerves are suitable donor nerves to the axillary nerve and a potential source of reinnervation of the suprascapular nerve in upper brachial plexus injury. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

The first biodegradable empty single lumen or hollow nerve tubes are currently available for clinical use and are being used mostly in the repair of small-diameter nerves with nerve defects of {\textless} 3 cm. These nerve tubes are made of different biomaterials using various fabrication techniques. As a result these tubes also differ in physical properties. In addition, several modifications to the common hollow nerve tube (for example, the addition of Schwann cells, growth factors, and internal frameworks) are being investigated that may increase the gap that can be bridged. This combination of chemical, physical, and biological factors has made the design of a nerve conduit into a complex process that demands close collaboration of bioengineers, neuroscientists, and peripheral nerve surgeons. In this article the authors discuss the different steps that are involved in the process of the design of an ideal nerve conduit for peripheral nerve repair. (DOI: 10.3171/FOC.2009.26.2.E5).},

abstract = {Despite the progress in understanding the pathophysiology of peripheral nervous system injury and regeneration, as well as advancements in microsurgical techniques, peripheral nerve injuries are still a major challenge for reconstructive surgeons. Thorough knowledge of anatomy, pathophysiology, and surgical reconstruction is a prerequisite of proper peripheral nerve injury management. This chapter reviews the currently available surgical treatment options for different types of nerve injuries in clinical conditions. In overview of direct nerve repair, various end-to-end coaptation techniques and the role of end-to-side repair for proximal nerve injuries is described. When primary repair cannot be performed without undue tension, nerve grafting or tubulization techniques are required. Current gold standard for bridging nerve gaps is nerve autografting. However, disadvantages of this approach, such as donor site morbidity and limited length of available graft material encouraged the search for alternative means of nerve gap reconstruction. Nerve allografting was introduced for repair of extensive nerve injuries. Tubulization techniques with natural or artificial conduits are applicable as an alternative for bridging short nerve defects without the morbidities associated with harvesting of autologous nerve grafts. Achieving better outcomes depends both on the advancements in microsurgical techniques and introduction of molecular biology discoveries into clinical practice. The field of peripheral nerve research is dynamically developing and concentrates on more sophisticated approaches tested at the basic science level. Future directions in peripheral nerve reconstruction including, tolerance induction and minimal immunosuppression for nerve allografting, cell based supportive therapies and bioengineering of nerve conduits are also reviewed in this chapter. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The presence of axillary artery aneurysm and/or thrombus in overhead throwing athletes has been linked, theoretically, with the finding of compression by the humeral head induced by a diagnostic arm maneuver. However, whether this intermittent compression is incidental or of pathological significance has yet to be determined. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), intima-media thickness (IMT) and maximum vasodilatory capacity were measured locally (3rd portion of the axillary artery) and downstream (brachial artery) in individuals previously tested for inducible axillary artery compression (compressor group [COMP]: n = 8, mean (SD) age: 23 (4) y; "noncompressor" control group [NONCOMP]: n = 8, 26 (4) y). A high-resolution ultrasound machine recorded arterial diameter and blood flow velocity. A rapid inflation/deflation pneumatic cuff placed distal to the site of measurement induced reactive hyperemia. Custom-designed wall tracking software with synchronized Doppler waveform analysis detected changes in arterial diameter, blood flow velocity and shear rate from baseline to 3 min after cuff deflation. Glyceryl trinitrate and/or ischemic hand grip exercises were administered to induce maximum vasodilation. No significant differences in FMD, IMT or maximum vasodilator capacity were observed between groups at the axillary artery. However, the downstream brachial FMD response was significantly diminished in the COMP group (6.38 [3.28]{\%}) compared with the NONCOMP group (10.38 [2.74]{\%}; p = 0.006) despite a comparable shear rate between groups (COMP: 81.92 (44.55) s-1; NONCOMP: 83.18 (40.02) s-1; p = 0.961). Pooled data revealed a significant negative relationship (r = -0.52, p = 0.038) between the FMD response and degree of arterial compression. These results suggest a chronic change in downstream vascular function in individuals demonstrating clinically significant inducible axillary artery compression.

abstract = {Purpose: To use Doppler ultrasound 1) to assess the relationship between exercise intensity and changes in femoral and axillary artery diameter, 2) to determine whether volume blood flow (BF) measured during early recovery accurately reflects exercise BF, and 3) to assess the influence of artery caliber and/or site as well as exercise intensity on BF measurement reproducibility. Methods: Thirteen healthy subjects (mean age 25.9 ± 7.7 yr) performed progressive and maximal leg-extension (LE) and elbow-flexion (EF) exercises in the supine position. The duration of each stage was 150 s, followed by a 30-s recovery period. Arterial diameter and blood flow velocity were recorded simultaneously and continuously during the last 30 s of exercise as well as 30 s into recovery. Results: Arterial dilation was 3.5 and 6.5{\%} at maximal effort in femoral and axillary arteries, respectively. A significant increase was observed for both arteries from workload 2 to peak exercise when arterial cross-sectional area was calculated. Blood flow velocity during the recovery period was significantly different from end-exercise values, depending on time and workload. The coefficients of variation of BF measurement during exercise were 7.1-12.1{\%} and 6.4-9.5{\%} in LE and EF, respectively. Conclusion: This study showed that BF measurement with Doppler ultrasound during exercise is reproducible but requires measurement of arterial diameter at each workload. Measurements performed immediately after exercise cannot be used as a surrogate for blood flow velocity during exercise. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

Methods: Reference values from 75 healthy subjects and their correlation to age, height, weight and sex are reported. Results: The mean values in PN were: (1) intranerve CSA-variability: median 1.05 (SD ± 0.13), ulnar 1.53 (SD ± 0.51), fibular 1.33 (SD ± 0.37), tibial 1.39 (SD ± 0.39), (2) internerve CSA-variability 1.76 (SD ± 0.37), (3) intraplexus CSA-variability 1.52 (SD ± 0.37), (4) side-to-side difference ratio of the CSA-variability: median 1.21 (SD ± 0.04), ulnar 1.2 (SD ± 0.25), fibular 1.19 (SD ± 0.23), tibial 1.28 (SD ± 0.24) and brachial plexus 1.19 (SD ± 0.23). CSA did not correlate with height in PN, but correlated with weight in the ulnar nerve [Guyon's canal, r= 0.411, p= 0.0237, elbow r= 0.409, p= 0.0248]. Significant changes between sex were found only in the ulnar (Guyon's canal, p= 0.0265), fibular (popliteal fossa, p= 0.0336) and sural nerve (p= 0.048). CSA decreased with age in the median (axilla, p= 0.0236), and radial nerve (spiral groove, p= 0.0037) and increased in the tibial nerve (ankle, p{\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions: The CSA reference values reported seem to correlate at certain sites with age, weight and sex but not with height.

The reported diameters appear to be small when compared to those known from surgery (=actual diameter). The actual diameter is compared with the diameter on ultrasonography. Patients and methods: Nine patients that were scheduled for decompression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow underwent an ultrasonographic examination preoperatively and intraoperatively. Longitudinal and transversal sonographical scans were made. The maximal diameters of the ulnar nerve at ultrasound were compared with the maximal diameter of the ulnar nerve intraoperatively. Results: Pre- and intraoperatively on the longitudinal scans, the maximal diameter is smaller than the actual maximal diameter of the ulnar nerve. The difference was 3.7 ± 1.0 mm (p {\textless} 0.001) 3.0 ± 1.1 mm (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. The same was true on the transverse scans: 1.5 ± 1.3 mm (p = 0.008) versus 1.1 ± 0.6 mm (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The diameter of the ulnar nerve as determined sonographically suggesting ulnar neuropathy does not correspond with the anatomically determined actual diameter.

abstract = {Concepts of neuronal damage and repair date back to ancient times. The research in this topic has been growing ever since and numerous nerve repair techniques have evolved throughout the years. Due to our greater understanding of nerve injuries and repair we now distinguish between central and peripheral nervous system. In this review, we have chosen to concentrate on peripheral nerve injuries and in particular those involving the hand. There are no reviews bringing together and summarizing the latest research evidence concerning the most up-to-date techniques used to improve hand function. Therefore, by identifying and evaluating all the published literature in this field, we have summarized all the available information about the advances in peripheral nerve techniques used to improve hand function. The most important ones are the use of resorbable poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB), epineural end-to-end suturing, graft repair, nerve transfer, side to side neurorrhaphy and end to side neurorrhaphy between median, radial and ulnar nerves, nerve transplant, nerve repair, external neurolysis and epineural sutures, adjacent neurotization without nerve suturing, Agee endoscopic operation, tourniquet induced anesthesia, toe transfer and meticulous intrinsic repair, free auto nerve grafting, use of distal based neurocutaneous flaps and tubulization. At the same time we found that the patient's age, tension of repair, time of repair, level of injury and scar formation following surgery affect the prognosis. Despite the thorough findings of this systematic review we suggest that further research in this field is needed.},

abstract = {Rodent models are used extensively for studying nerve regeneration, but little is known about how sprouting and pruning influence peripheral nerve fiber counts and motor neuron pools. The purpose of this study was to identify fluctuations in nerve regeneration and neuronal survival over time. One hundred and forty-four Lewis rats were randomized to end-to-end repair or nerve grafting (1.5 cm graft) after sciatic nerve transection. Quantitative histomorphometry and retrograde labeling of motor neurons were performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months and supplemented by electron microscopy. Fiber counts and motor neuron counts increased between 1 and 3 months, followed by plateau. End-to-end repair resulted in persistently higher fiber counts compared to the grafting for all time points (P {\textless} 0.05). Percent neural tissue and myelin width increased with time while fibrin debris dissipated. In conclusion, these data detail the natural history of regeneration and demonstrate that overall fiber counts may remain stable despite pruning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Object. Additional nerve transfer options are important to the peripheral nerve surgeon to maximize patient outcomes following nerve injuries. Potential regional donors may also be injured or involved in the primary disease. Therefore, potential contralateral donor nerves would be desirable. To the authors' knowledge, use of the contralateral spinal accessory nerve (SAN) has not been explored for ipsilateral neurotization procedures. In the current study, therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the SAN as a potential donor nerve for contralateral nerve injuries by using a novel technique. Methods. In 10 cadavers, the SAN was harvested using a posterior approach, and tunneled subcutaneously to the contralateral side for neurotization to various branches of the brachial plexus. Measurements were made of the SAN available for transfer and of its diameter. Results. The authors found an SAN length of approximately 20 cm (from transition of upper and middle fibers of the trapezius muscle to approximately 2-4 cm superior to the insertion of the trapezius muscle onto the spinous process of T-12) available for nerve transposition. The average diameter was 2.5 mm. Conclusions. Based on these findings, the contralateral SAN may be considered for ipsilateral neurotization to the suprascapular and axillary nerves.},

abstract = {The blood supply to the reconstructed peripheral nerve is one of the most significant factors for adequate regeneration and functional recovery. Experiments were performed to compare the revascularization of the tibial nerve of the rabbit following classical end-to-end anastomosis and autogenous nerve grafting. The animals were divided into two groups and from each animal a 1.5 cm length of the nerve was excised. End-to-end anastomosis was then performed in the first group of 12 animals. The second group received autogenous grafts from the peroneal nerve. A microangiographic study was performed after a survival time of 30 days. The microangiograms were analysed quantitatively, and the density of the vascular network at the sites of anastomosis and at the graft was quantified. The results indicated that nerve repair by means of grafts creates more favourable conditions for revascularization both of the grafts and of their connections with the nerve than end-to-end anastomosis. {\textcopyright} 1986 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract = {Objective: Trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative for patients not eligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. When peripheral access is not amenable by the transfemoral route (TF-TAVI), the most-used approaches are the trans-apical (TAp-TAVI) and the trans-axillary (TAx-TAVI). The aim of this study is to report the outcomes in a single-center series of consecutive patients treated by TAVI using the different approaches. Methods: From November 2007 to June 2010, 177 patients underwent TAVI by the same multispeciality valve team. TAp-TAVI was performed in the operative room, while TF-TAVI and TAx-TAVI were done in the catheterization laboratory. Follow-up was 100{\%} complete (mean 6.0 ± 6.8 months). Results: TF-TAVI, TAx-TAVI, and TAp-TAVI were performed in 140 (79.1{\%}), 19 (10.7{\%}), and 16 patients (9.1{\%}), respectively. The groups were not different in terms of age (p=0.6), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p=0.6), Log-EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) (p=0.3), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (p=0.7), while peripheral artery disease was higher in the TAp-TAVI and TAx-TAVI groups compared with the TF-TAVI group (P{\textless}0.0001). The Charlson score was 10.7 ± 14.9, 5.8 ± 1.2, and 5.9 ± 1.8 for TAp-TAVI, TAx-TAVI, and TF-TAVI, respectively (p=0.02). In-hospital (30-day) mortality was 1.4{\%} (2/140), 12.5{\%} (2/16), and 5.3{\%} (1/19) for TF, Tap, and TAx, respectively (p=0.03). At follow-up, 6 months' actuarial survival was 72.2 ± 12.0{\%}, 67.4 ± 17.4{\%}, and 88.4 ± 3.1{\%} for TAp-TAVI, TAx-TAVI, and TF-TAVI, respectively (p=0.3). Conclusions: Similar to findings from recent, larger trials, patients undergoing TF-TAVI in high-risk patients had excellent 6-month results. Although TAx-TAVI was associated with lower hospital mortality, it shared the same 6-month outcomes of TAp-TAVI, probably due to a similar selection bias. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.},

@article{Landry2012,
abstract = {Background. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of robot-assisted transaxillary thyroid surgery (RATS) to the standard open technique for thyroid lobectomy in the U.S. population. Methods. Comparison was made between 25 consecutive patients who underwent thyroid lobectomy via RATS and 25 patients who underwent open thyroid lobectomy. All patients met predetermined criteria for RATS. Clinical characteristics of patients and operative data were compared between groups using the Fisher exact or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results. The RATS and open groups were similar in gender (92{\%} vs 84{\%} female), median body mass index (BMI) (25 vs 26), preoperative cytology (P = .71), and postoperative diagnosis (P = .91). Operative time for the RATS group was longer than the open group [median 121 minutes (range 74-199 minutes) vs 68 minutes (41-112 minutes), P {\textless} .0001]. Estimated blood loss was greater in the RATS group [median 10 cc (0-150 cc) vs 0 cc (0-25 cc), P = .0042]. Unlike the open group, postoperative complications in the RATS group included 2 patients with neurological deficits in the brachial plexus distribution. The postoperative incidence of temporary hoarseness, bleeding, infection, seroma, numbness, and length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions. In a select group of patients, RATS is comparable to open thyroid lobectomy in terms of postoperative complications and hospital stay. Patients should be counseled that RATS is associated with a longer operative time, a potential for brachial plexus neurological deficits, and larger (although still low) blood loss. A prospective trial further evaluating cost, quality of life, and patient-reported satisfaction is warranted. {\textcopyright} Society of Surgical Oncology 2011.},

@article{Mian2014,
abstract = {The trend towards regional anesthesia began in the late 1800s when William Halsted and Richard Hall experimented with cocaine as a local anesthetic for upper and lower limb procedures. Regional anesthesia of the upper limb can be achieved by blocking the brachial plexus at varying stages along the course of the trunks, divisions, cords and terminal branches. The four most common techniques used in the clinical setting are the interscalene block, the supraclavicular block, the infraclavicular block, and the axillary block. Each approach has its own unique set of advantages and indications for use. The supraclavicular block is most effective for anesthesia of the mid-humerus and below. Infraclavicular blocks are useful for procedures requiring continuous anesthesia. Axillary blocks provide effective anesthesia distal to the elbow, and interscalene blocks are best suited for the shoulder and proximal upper limb. The two most common methods for localizing the appropriate nerves for brachial plexus blocks are nerve stimulation and ultrasound guidance. Recent literature on brachial plexus blocks has largely focused on these two techniques to determine which method has greater efficacy. Ultrasound guidance has allowed the operator to visualize the needle position within the musculature and has proven especially useful in patients with anatomical variations. The aim of this study is to provide a review of the literature on the different approaches to brachial plexus blocks, including the indications, techniques, and relevant anatomical variations associated with the nerves involved.

@article{Ustuner2013,
abstract = {Purpose: Familiarity with the localization of the nerves in the neurovascular bundle that constitutes the axillary segment of the brachial plexus (BP) is important when applying ultrasound (US)-guided block anesthesia. Therefore in this study we aimed to delineate the anatomy of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves of the BP at the axilla with US and electrical stimulation. Materials and methods: The study included 60 patients who were scheduled to undergo upper-arm surgery with axillary block anesthesia. Prior to anesthesia, ulnar, radial, and median nerves were localized with US using a 12-h quadrant identification system that placed the axillary artery (AA) in the middle. The nerves were then functionally tested using a neurostimulator. Results: The radial nerve was mainly located in the 4-6 o'clock arc (posterior and posteromedial to AA) in 50 (83 {\%}) of patients. Ulnar nerve was mainly at the 12-3 o'clock arc (anteromedial to AA) in 51 (85 {\%}) of patients. Ulnar nerve showed a second peak at 9-10 o'clock quadrant (anterolateral to AA) in 11 {\%} (7) of patients. Median nerve location was most common in the 12 and 9 o'clock arc (anterior and anterolateral to AA) in 53 (88 {\%}) of the patients. Conclusions: Ultrasound is a useful tool for depicting BP anatomy in the axillary fossa prior to block anesthesia. Median, ulnar, and radial nerves form a highly consistent triangular pattern around the axillary artery that is easily recognizable with US. {\textcopyright} 2013 ISS.},

The high recurrence risk in pedigrees with early and severe PKD strongly suggests a common familial modifying background, but the mechanisms underlying the extensive phenotypic variability observed among affected family members remain unknown. Here, we describe severely affected patients with PKD who carry, in addition to their expected familial germ-line defect, additional mutations in PKD genes, including HNF-1$\beta$, which likely aggravate the phenotype. Our findings are consistent with a common pathogenesis and dosage theory for PKD and may propose a general concept for the modification of disease expression in other so-called monogenic disorders.

Although autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 2 (PKD2) is known to have a milder clinical phenotype than PKD1, neither disorder has been compared with an unaffected control population in terms of survival. We report the findings of a multicentre survey that aimed to define more precisely the survival and clinical expression of PKD1 and PKD2. Methods. Clinical data from 333 people with PKD1 (31 families) were compared with data from 291 people with PKD2 (31 families) and 398 geographically matched controls. Survival analysis was used to compare age-at-event data. Differences in the prevalence of complications were assessed by logistic regression. Findings. Median age at death or onset of end-stage renal disease was 53.0 years (95{\%} CI 51.2-54.8) in individuals with PKD1, 69.1 years (66.9-71.3) in those with PKD2, and 78.0 years (73.8-82.2) in controls. Women with PKD2 had a significantly longer median survival than men (71.0 [67.4-74.8] vs 67.3 [64.9-69.7] years), but no sex influence was apparent in PKD1. Age at presentation with kidney failure was later in PKD2 than in PKD1 (median age 74.0 [67.2-80.8] vs 54.3 [52.7-55.9] years). PKD2 patients were less likely to have hypertension (odds ratio 0.25 [95{\%} CI 0.15-0.42]), a history of urinary-tract infection (0.50 [0.31-0.83]), or haematuria (0.59 [0.35-0.98]). Interpretation. Although PKD2 is clinically milder than PKD1, it has a deleterious impact on overall life expectancy and cannot be regarded as a benign disorder.},

abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) which accounts for 15{\%} of all renal transplantations emerges as the third cause of kidney transplantation in France. In addition to routine evaluation before transplantation, the ADPKD patient requires special assessment of three aspects: should potential kidney complications (recurrent upper tract infection or haemorrhage) or kidney size assessed by computed tomography require nephrectomy prior to transplantation? Is it advisable to detect intracranial aneurysm (ICA) in patients with a relative having experienced ruptured ICA? When transplantation from a living relative is considered, the existence of ADPKD in the donor should be formally ruled out by imaging or genetic studies. The risk of recurrence of ADPKD post-transplantation does not exist. Nevertheless other complications may occur. Thus, an increased incidence of colonic perforation has been reported. In addition, as compared to non-ADPKD patients, an increased risk for both skin cancer and new-onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus has been reported recently after kidney transplantation. Finally, because these patients suffer from an inherited syndrome, physicians should carefully consider the personal and familial history before and after transplantation in order to respond to fatalism in some cases, or to attenuate excessive enthusiasm in the others. Altogether, it apears that a specific approach is needed for ADPKD patients when considering renal transplantation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS and Association Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de N{\'{e}}phrologie.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a set of indicators on survival, life expectancy and causes of death of patients in chronic renal failure treated by dialysis or transplantation beginning a first replacement therapy between 2002 and 2011. Age strongly influences survival on dialysis. Thus, one year survival of patients under age 65 is over 90{\%}. After 5 years, among patients over 85 years, it is more than 15{\%}. The presence of diabetes or one or more cardiovascular comorbidities also significantly worse patient survival. In terms of trend, we do not find significant improvement in the 2-year survival between patients in the cohort 2006-2007 and the 2008-2009 cohort. Cardiovascular diseases account for 27{\%} of causes of death to infectious diseases (12{\%}) and cancer (10{\%}). Life expectancy of patients is highly dependent on their treatment. Thus, a transplant patient aged 30 has a life expectancy of 41 years versus 23 years for a dialysis patient. Transplant patients have a mortality rate much lower than those of dialysis patients. Thus, between 60 and 69 years, for 1000 patients in dialysis in 2011, 127 died within the year. For 1000 patients of the same age, who have a functioning kidney transplant, 24 died within the year. {\textcopyright} 2013 Association Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de N{\'{e}}phrologie.

abstract = {Results General population incidence ratios in 2009-2010 were unchanged from 2001-2002 (incidence ratio, 1.02). Of patients with ADPKD, 48.1{\%} received more than 12 months of nephrology care before RRT; preemptive transplantation was the initial RRT in 14.3{\%} and fistula was the initial hemodialysis access in 35.8{\%}. During 4.9 years of follow-up, patients with ADPKD were more likely to be listed for transplantation (IR, 11.7 [95{\%} CI, 11.5-12.0] vs 8.4 [95{\%} CI, 8.2-8.7] per 100 person-years) and to undergo transplantation (IR, 9.8 [95{\%} CI, 9.5-10.0] vs 4.8 [95{\%} CI, 4.7-5.0] per 100 person-years) and less likely to die (IR, 5.6 [95{\%} CI, 5.4-5.7] vs 15.5 [95{\%} CI, 15.3-15.8] per 100 person-years) than matched controls without ADPKD.
Limitations Retrospective nonexperimental registry-based study of associations; cause-and-effect relationships cannot be determined.
Conclusions Although outcomes on dialysis therapy are better for patients with ADPKD than for those without ADPKD, access to predialysis nephrology care and nondeclining ESRD rates may be a cause for concern.
Background Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is amenable to early detection and specialty care. Thus, while important to patients with the condition, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from ADPKD also may be an indicator of the overall state of nephrology care.
Study Design Retrospective cohort study of temporal trends in ESRD from ADPKD and pre-renal replacement therapy (RRT) nephrologist care, 2001-2010 (n = 23,772).
Setting {\&} Participants US patients who initiated maintenance RRT from 2001 through 2010 (n = 1,069,343) from US Renal Data System data.
Predictor ESRD from ADPKD versus from other causes for baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes; interval 2001-2005 versus 2006-2010 for comparisons of cohort of patients with ESRD from ADPKD.
Outcomes Death, wait-listing for kidney transplant, kidney transplantation.
Measurements US census data were used as population denominators. Poisson distribution was used to compute incidence rates (IRs). Incidence ratios were standardized to rates in 2001-2002 for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Patients with and without ADPKD were matched to compare clinical outcomes. Poisson regression was used to calculate IRs and adjusted HRs for clinical events after inception of RRT.},

abstract = {Background. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth most common renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Still, there are few epidemiological data on the prevalence of, and survival on RRT for ADPKD. Methods. This study used data from the ERA-EDTA Registry on RRT prevalence and survival on RRT in 12 European countries with 208 million inhabitants. We studied four 5-year periods (1991-2010). Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and by Cox proportional hazards regression. Results. From the first to the last study period, the prevalence of RRT for ADPKD increased from 56.8 to 91.1 per million population (pmp). The percentage of prevalent RRT patients with ADPKD remained fairly stable at 9.8{\%}. Two-year survival of ADPKD patients on RRT (adjusted for age, sex and country) increased significantly from 89.0 to 92.8{\%}, and was higher than for non-ADPKD subjects. Improved survival was noted for all RRT modalities: haemodialysis [adjusted hazard ratio for mortality during the last versus first time period 0.75 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.61-0.91), peritoneal dialysis 0.55 (0.38-0.80) and transplantation 0.52 (0.32-0.74)]. Cardiovascular mortality as a proportion of total mortality on RRT decreased more in ADPKD patients (from 53 to 29{\%}), than in non-ADPKD patients (from 44 to 35{\%}). Of note, the incidence rate of RRT for ADPKD remained relatively stable at 7.6 versus 8.3 pmp from the first to the last study period, which will be discussed in detail in a separate study. Conclusions. In ADPKD patients on RRT, survival has improved markedly, especially due to a decrease in cardiovascular mortality. This has led to a considerable increase in the number of ADPKD patients being treated with RRT.},

abstract = {End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with an overall oneyear mortality of 23.5{\%} in the US, of which cardiac causes constitute 50{\%} of all deaths. Data on incident ESRD patients were obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration's 2728 and 2746 forms by special request from the ESRD Network of New York. 4948 ESRD patients, who started dialysis in New York State from April 1, 1995, through April 1, 1996, were assessed to identify risk factors present at the initiation of dialysis that predict cardiac death. 899 deaths were registered during the 19-month-follow-up period, 50{\%} of which were from cardiac causes. Using the Cox-proportional hazards model, the increasing age category, white race, the presence of one or more vascular co-morbid conditions, and the presence of diabetes and one or more cardiac co-morbid conditions significantly predicted cardiac death (p {\textless} 0.05). Diabetes increased the risk for cardiac death by 48{\%} for those patients without any cardiac co-morbidities (RR = 1.48, p {\textless} 0.0082). In contrast with results observed in the general population, gender, serum albumin and body mass index were not significant predictors of cardiac death. In identifying risk factors present at the initiation of dialysis that predict cardiac death, this study highlights factors that may be modified prior to dialysis initiation in order to improve life expectancy and mortality rates and decrease health care costs for the ESRD population.},

@article{Harris2010a,
abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common nephropathy caused by mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2. Mutations in PKD1 account for ∼85{\%} of cases and cause more severe disease than mutations in PKD2. Diagnosis of ADPKD before the onset of symptoms is usually performed using renal imaging by either ultrasonography, CT or MRI. In general, these modalities are reliable for the diagnosis of ADPKD in older individuals. However, molecular testing can be valuable when a definite diagnosis is required in young individuals, in individuals with a negative family history of ADPKD, and to facilitate preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Although linkage-based diagnostic approaches are feasible in large families, direct mutation screening is generally more applicable. As ADPKD displays a high level of allelic heterogeneity, complete screening of both genes is required. Consequently, such screening approaches are expensive. Screening of individuals with ADPKD detects mutations in up to 91{\%} of cases. However, only ∼65{\%} of patients have definite mutations with ∼26{\%} having nondefinite changes that require further evaluation. Collation of known variants in the ADPKD mutation database and systematic scoring of nondefinite variants is increasing the diagnostic value of molecular screening. Genic information can be of prognostic value and recent investigation of hypomorphic PKD1 alleles suggests that allelic information may also be valuable in some atypical cases. In the future, when effective therapies are developed for ADPKD, molecular testing may become increasingly widespread. Rapid developments in DNA sequencing may also revolutionize testing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Between January 1, 1935 and December 31, 1980, adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) was diagnosed in 40 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, resulting in an ageand sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 1.38/100,000 person-years. In addition, 16 cases were detected at autopsy, increasing the rate to 2.06. It is estimated that 16 additional cases would have been discovered had all deaths come to autopsy, resulting in a rate of 2.75, or approximately twice the incidence rate of cases diagnosed during life . Because of improvements in medical care and diagnostic techniques, APKD has been diagnosed earlier and more frequently in the recent decades. This, along with therapeutic advances, explains the improvement in kidney and patient survival for the patients diagnosed during 1956–1980, as compared to those diagnosed during 1935-1955. Normotension at diagnosis tended to be associated with better kidney and/or patient survival. Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death. {\textcopyright} 1983, National Kidney Foundation, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: To explore and evaluate the most common factors causing therapeutic non-compliance. Methods: A qualitative review was undertaken by a literature search of the Medline database from 1970 to 2005 to identify studies evaluating the factors contributing to therapeutic non-compliance. Results: A total of 102 articles was retrieved and used in the review from the 2095 articles identified by the literature review process. From the literature review, it would appear that the definition of therapeutic compliance is adequately resolved. The preliminary evaluation revealed a number of factors that contributed to therapeutic non-compliance. These factors could be categorized to patient-centered factors, therapy-related factors, social and economic factors, healthcare system factors, and disease factors. For some of these factors, the impact on compliance was not unequivocal, but for other factors, the impact was inconsistent and contradictory. Conclusion: There are numerous studies on therapeutic noncompliance over the years. The factors related to compliance may be better categorized as "soft" and hard" factors as the approach in countering their effects may differ. The review also highlights that the interaction of the various factors has not been studied systematically. Future studies need to address this interaction issue, as this may be crucial to reducing the level of non-compliance in general, and to enhancing the possibility of achieving the desired healthcare outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Dove Medical Press Limited.

abstract = {Background: Nutrient-based recommendations are defined for populations, but the dietary choices needed to fulfill them at the individual level deserve further exploration. Objective: The objective was to describe the dietary changes needed to achieve nutritional recommendations for each individual of a population. Design: An individual diet model was specifically developed for each adult participating in the French national INCA (Enqu{\^{e}}te Individuelle et Nationale sur les Consommations Alimentaires) dietary survey (n = 1171). Starting from each individual weekly food intake (observed diets), an isocaloric modeled diet was designed by linear programming to simultaneously meet the French nutrient recommendations for 32 nutrients while deviating the least from the observed food intake. Modeled diets were paired with observed diets for statistical comparison. Results: A new nutritionally adequate diet was obtained for each individual. In half the modeled diets, {\textless}5 of the foods usually consumed were replaced. The amount of foods selected in the modeled diets varied from individual to individual, and this variability followed that found in observed diets. Fruit, vegetables, grains, legumes, dried fruit, unsalted nuts, fresh dairy products, and fish were increased in modeled diets. Fatty fish and walnuts were added to each modeled diet. In contrast, red meats, deli meats, cheese, mixed dishes, and salted snacks were decreased. Sweets were also decreased but to a lesser extent. Conclusions: This new individual diet modeling approach offers the possibility of translating nutrient recommendations into realistic food choices for all individuals from a representative population. The results showed that nutrient needs can be fulfilled in many different ways, depending on initial individual food patterns. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract = {An innovative methodology has been used for the formulation development of Cyclosporine A (CyA) nanoparticles. In the present study the static mixer technique, which is a novel method for producing nanoparticles, was employed. The formulation optimum was calculated by the modified Shepard's method (MSM), an advanced data analysis technique not adopted so far in pharmaceutical applications. Controlled precipitation was achieved injecting the organic CyA solution rapidly into an aqueous protective solution by means of a static mixer. Furthermore the computer based MSM was implemented for data analysis, visualization, and application development. For the optimization studies, the gelatin/lipoid S75 amounts and the organic/aqueous phase were selected as independent variables while the obtained particle size as a dependent variable. The optimum predicted formulation was characterized by cryo-TEM microscopy, particle size measurements, stability, and in vitro release. The produced nanoparticles contain drug in amorphous state and decreased amounts of stabilizing agents. The dissolution rate of the lyophilized powder was significantly enhanced in the first 2 h. MSM was proved capable to interpret in detail and to predict with high accuracy the optimum formulation. The mixer technique was proved capable to develop CyA nanoparticulate formulations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate many genes critical for tumorigenesis. We profiled miRNAs from 11 normal breast tissues, 17 noninvasive, 151 invasive breast carcinomas, and 6 cell lines by in-house-developed barcoded Solexa sequencing. miRNAs were organized in genomic clusters representing promoter-controlled miRNA expression and sequence families representing seed sequence-dependent miRNA target regulation. Unsupervised clustering of samples by miRNA sequence families best reflected the clustering based on mRNA expression available for this sample set. Clustering and comparative analysis of miRNA read frequencies showed that normal breast samples were separated from most noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinomas by increased miR-21 (the most abundant miRNA in carcinomas) and multiple decreased miRNA families (including miR-98/let-7), with most miRNA changes apparent already in the noninvasive carcinomas. In addition, patients that went on to develop metastasis showed increased expression of mir-423, and triplenegative breast carcinomas were most distinct from other tumor subtypes due to upregulation of the mir-17-92 cluster. However, absolute miRNA levels between normal breast and carcinomas did not reveal any significant differences. We also discovered two polymorphic nucleotide variations among the more abundant miRNAs miR-181a (T19G) and miR-185 (T16G), but we did not identify nucleotide variations expected for classical tumor suppressor function associated with miRNAs. The differentiation of tumor subtypes and prediction of metastasis based on miRNA levels is statistically possible but is not driven by deregulation of abundant miRNAs, implicating far fewer miRNAs in tumorigenic processes than previously suggested. {\textcopyright}2011 AACR.},

abstract = {The root cause for most cases of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is mutations in the polycystin-1 (PC1) gene. While PC1 has been implicated in a perplexing variety of protein interactions and signaling pathways, what its normal function is and why its disruption leads to the proliferation of renal epithelial cells are unknown. Recent results suggest that PC1 is involved in mechanotransduction by primary cilia measuring the degree of luminal fluid flow. PC1 has also recently been shown to regulate the mTOR and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 6 pathways. These two pathways are normally dormant in the healthy kidney but are activated in response to injury and appear to drive a proliferative repair response. This review develops the idea that a critical function of PC1 and primary cilia in the adult kidney may be to sense renal injury by detecting changes in luminal fluid flow and to trigger proliferation. Constitutive activation of these pathways in ADPKD would lead to the futile attempt to repair a nonexisting injury, resulting in cyst growth. The existence of many known cellular and molecular similarities between renal repair and ADPKD supports this model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Early brain injury (EBI) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although the neuroprotective effects of ghrelin have been demonstrated in several studies, whether ghrelin reduces EBI after SAH remains unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that treatment with ghrelin would attenuate EBI after SAH, and that this protection would be mediated, at least in part, by activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=100) were randomly divided into the following groups: control group (n=20), SAH group (n=20), SAH+vehicle group (n=20), SAH+ghrelin group (n=20) and SAH+ghrelin+LY294002 group (n=20). The rats were injected with autologous blood (0.3 mL) into the prechiasmatic cistern to induce SAH. Ghrelin (80 $\mu$g/kg, IP), or an equal volume of vehicle, was administered immediately after surgery. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, was applied to manipulate the proposed pathway. Mortality, neurological scores, brain edema, cell apoptosis, and the expression of p-Akt, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were assayed after 24 h SAH. Ghrelin significantly improved neurological function and reduced neuronal apoptosis and brain edema at 24 h after SAH. The level of p-Akt, expressed mainly in neurons, was markedly up-regulated. Additionally, the level of cleaved caspase-3 was decreased by ghrelin treatment. The beneficial effects of ghrelin in SAH rats were partially suppressed by LY294002. These results demonstrate that ghrelin may reduce EBI after SAH, via a mechanism involving the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To determine the mechanism responsible for ghrelin's neuroprotective effects after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock. BACKGROUND:: Ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone, has been demonstrated to possess multiple functions, including upregulation of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and stimulation of the vagus nerve. Recent evidence has indicated that ghrelin is neuroprotective. We, therefore, hypothesized that ghrelin protects rats against TBI and hemorrhagic shock through upregulation of UCP2, involving stimulation of the vagus nerve. METHODS:: Brain injury was induced by dropping a 450 g of weight from 1.5 m onto a steel helmet attached to the skull of male adult rats. Immediately after TBI, a midline laparotomy was performed, and both lumbar veins were isolated and severed at the junction with the vena cava. The abdomen was kept open for 20 minutes. At 45 minutes after TBI and uncontrolled hemorrhage (UH), ghrelin (4, 8, or 16 nmol/rat) or 1 mL of normal saline (vehicle) was intravenously administered. The Neurological Severity Scale (NSS), morphological alterations and $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein expression in the brain, systemic organ injury markers (ie, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate), and UCP2 expression in the cortex were measured. To determine whether the protective effect of ghrelin is mediated through upregulation of UCP2, genipin, a specific UCP2 antagonist, was administered intravenously before the injection of ghrelin in animals with TBI and UH. The role of the vagus nerve was assessed by performing vagotomy immediately before ghrelin administration. RESULTS:: Ghrelin attenuated brain injury and facilitated functional recovery after TBI and UH. Ghrelin increased UCP2 expression in the cortex, and administration of genipin abolished ghrelin's protection after TBI and UH. Furthermore, vagotomy prevented the beneficial effects of ghrelin and eliminated ghrelin-induced UCP2 upregulation after TBI and UH. CONCLUSIONS:: The protective effects of ghrelin after TBI and UH seem to be related to upregulation of UCP2 expression in the brain and requiring the intact vagus nerve.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

These include variations in the cross‐sectional areas devoted to fascicular and epineurial tissue, the fascicular redistribution and mixing of different branch fibers brought about by fascicular plexuses, and the numbers of nerve fibers representing individual branches. The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression. The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types—each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features. Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk. The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1990 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Damage to the peripheral nervous system is surprisingly common and occurs primarily from trauma or a complication of surgery. Although recovery of nerve function occurs in many mild injuries, outcomes are often unsatisfactory following severe trauma. Nerve repair and regeneration presents unique clinical challenges and opportunities, and substantial contributions can be made through the informed application of biomedical engineering strategies. This article reviews the clinical presentations and classification of nerve injuries, in addition to the state of the art for surgical decision-making and repair strategies. This discussion presents specific challenges that must be addressed to realistically improve the treatment of nerve injuries and promote widespread recovery. In particular, nerve defects a few centimeters in length use a sensory nerve autograft as the standard technique; however, this approach is limited by the availability of donor nerve and comorbidity associated with additional surgery. Moreover, we currently have an inadequate ability to noninvasively assess the degree of nerve injury and to track axonal regeneration. As a result, wait-and-see surgical decisions can lead to undesirable and less successful "delayed" repair procedures. In this fight for time, degeneration of the distal nerve support structure and target progresses, ultimately blunting complete functional recovery. Thus, the most pressing challenges in peripheral nerve repair include the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts that match or exceed the performance of autografts, the ability to noninvasively assess nerve damage and track axonal regeneration, and approaches to maintain the efficacy of the distal pathway and targets during the regenerative process. Biomedical engineering strategies can address these issues to substantially contribute at both the basic and applied levels, improving surgical management and functional recovery following severe peripheral nerve injury. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Begell House, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Several recent reports have described the detection of circulating, cancer-related RNA molecules in serum or plasma from cancer patients, but little is known about the biology of this extracellular RNA. We aimed to determine how RNA is protected against degradation in serum, to optimize RNA isolation from large volumes of serum, and to test our optimized assays for serum-based cancer detection. Methods: We used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis to investigate the isolation and biology of extracellular plasma RNA. We then examined the presence of amplifiable RNA transcripts in plasma and serum from controls and from patients with esophageal cancer and malignant melanoma. Results: We found that extracellular RNA in plasma is highly degraded and can be isolated most efficiently by guanidinium-phenol extraction followed by precipitation. Extracellular RNA is stable in serum for up to 3 h but is destroyed immediately by addition of detergents. Extracellular RNA can be captured on 0.2 $\mu$m filters, allowing concentration of RNA from several milliliters of plasma. When we concentrated RNA from up to 4 mL of serum, detection of cancer-related transcripts in serum from cancer patients and controls was infrequent and inconsistent. Conclusions: Extracellular RNA is most likely protected within protein or lipid vesicles, possibly apoptotic bodies, which can be disrupted by detergents. Despite optimizing many aspects of plasma RNA detection, we were unable to reproducibly detect cancer-related transcripts. Our data suggest that measurement of circulating RNA may not be a good approach to early cancer diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of chronic neuropathic pain are not clear. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) might show a special feature for chronic nervous lesions. However, little is known about the changes in circulating miRNAs for the neuropathic pain. Therefore, changes in the circulating miRNAs expression profile for the neuropathic pain were investigated. Serum was collected from rats before and after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) surgery, and a microarray analysis was performed to determine the changes in miRNA expression profile. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in serum from the same individuals, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), was also measured. The results showed that the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$, and MCP-1 were significantly elevated in SNL rats which were significantly correlated with pain levels. Nine miRNAs with significantly different expression levels before and after SNL surgery were identified by microarray analysis, which were further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Compared with naive rats without SNL surgery, the expression of five miRNAs (hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-34c, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-30a-5p, and hsa-miR-206) in the serum of rats after SNL surgery was decreased and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-31-5p, hsa-miR-133b, hsa-miR-22, and hsa-miRPlus-A1087) were increased, suggesting that miRNA changes may involve in the regulation of neuropathic pain. TargetScan was used to predict mRNA targets for these miRNAs, and the results showed that the transcripts with multiple predicted target sites belonged to neurologically important pathways. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that several target genes are related to the activation of cell signaling associated with nervous lesions. In this study, the changes to miRNA profiles in serum under neuropathic pain conditions were shown for the first time, suggesting that circulating miRNAs profile in serum is a potential predictor for neuropathic pain.},

The strong paracrine capacity of these cells and not their differentiation capacity, is the principal mechanism of therapeutic action. MSCs robustly release exosomes, membrane vesicles ({\~{}}30–100 nm) originally derived in endosomes as intraluminal vesicles, which contain various molecular constituents including proteins and RNAs from maternal cells. Contained among these constituents, are small non-coding RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs), which play a key role in mediating biological function due to their prominent role in gene regulation. The release as well as the content of the MSC generated exosomes are modified by environmental conditions. Via exosomes, MSCs transfer their therapeutic factors, especially miRNAs, to recipient cells, and therein alter gene expression and thereby promote therapeutic response. The present review focuses on the paracrine mechanism of MSC exosomes, and the regulation and transfer of exosome content, especially the packaging and transfer of miRNAs which enhance tissue repair and functional recovery. Perspectives on the developing role of MSC mediated transfer of exosomes as a therapeutic approach will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Advances in the molecular segmentation of lung cancer has raised the possibility that neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) 1 fusions and NTRK1-3 expression may be promising molecular targets for future therapeutic interventions. We investigated the antitumor effects of a selective pan-NTRK inhibitor, AZD7451, by evaluating its antiproliferative effects on the KM12 cell line (a colorectal cancer cell line harboring a tropomyosin-NTRK1 fusion) and the H460 and H810 cell lines [large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) cell lines expressing NTRK2]. Relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to measure the mRNA levels of the NTRK1-3 tyrosine kinase domain using cDNA extracted from KM12, H460 and H810 cells. The cultures were grown in 6-well plates at a density of 1.0×10(6) cell/well and treated with AZD7451 at different doses (1, 2.5, 4, 5, 7.5 and 10 nM) using dimethyl sulfoxide as a control. Following a 24-h incubation, the number of surviving cells was measured using a hemocytometer. Furthermore, we performed western blotting of the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TRKA) and NTRK2 (TRKB) proteins and monitored the effects on the downstream signaling pathways Akt and ERK in these cell lines following treatment with AZD7451 (KM12 and H460: 0, 1 and 5 nM; H810: 0 and 5 nM). Immunohistochemical analyses of the surgically resected samples were also performed, using anti-NTRK1,2 antibodies. We performed reverse-transcription PCR and direct sequencing to investigate NTRK fusions in 268 patients; however, were unable to confirm the presence of NTRK fusions in this cohort. Further immunohistochemical analyses of the primary patient samples demonstrated that none of 61 tumors had NTRK1 overexpression and 7 of 39 samples exhibited NTRK2 expression, including 1 LCNEC sample. The qPCR results from the KM12 cell line revealed an apparent increase and overexpression of NTRK1 mRNA levels, while H460 cells exhibited a modest increase and the H810 cell line showed no apparent increase in the expression of any NTRK1-3 isoforms. There were no increases in the NTRK2 mRNA levels in any of the three cell lines, although KM12 and H460 cells exhibited low levels of NTRK2 expression. In vitro growth and proliferation of the KM12 cell line harboring the NTRK1-fusion was found to be potently inhibited by AZD7451 at a concentration of 2 nM. The proliferation of H460 cells was also found to be inhibited at a concentration of 5 nM, while there was no apparent inhibitory effect of AZD7451 on the growth or proliferation of H810 cells. Western blotting of KM12 cells treated with AZD7451 also revealed a potent inhibition of TRKA phosphorylation following AZD7451 treatment. Analysis of H460 cells confirmed the expression and inhibition of phosphorylation of NTRK2, whereas there was little to no expression of TRKA/B in H810 cells. Subsequent in vitro analysis of cell lines treated with the pan-TRK inhibitor AZD7451 suggested that the proliferation of KM12 and H460 cells was significantly inhibited by AZD7451, while H810 cells expressing low levels of wild-type NTRK1-3 were not inhibited. Based on these results, there is potential for a NTRK-dependent proliferation driver in a subpopulation of lung cancer patients with NTRK expression. In addition, pharmacological inhibition with a NTRK inhibitor, such as AZD7451, in cells harboring NTRK1 fusions, may be associated with beneficial antitumor effects.},

abstract = {Background: Neuroblastomas (NBs) are characterized by clinical heterogeneity, from spontaneous regression to relentless progression. The pattern of NTRK family gene expression contributes to these disparate behaviors. TrkA/NTRK1 is expressed in favorable NBs that regress or differentiate, whereas TrkB/NTRK2 and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are co-expressed in unfavorable NBs, representing an autocrine survival pathway. We determined the significance of NTRK family gene expression in a large, representative set of primary NBs. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the expression of the following genes in 814 NBs using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, P75/NGFR, nerve growth factor (NGF), BDNF, IGFR1, and EGFR. Expression (high vs. low) was dichotomized by median expression value and compared to clinical and biological variables as well as outcome. Results: High NTRK1 expression was strongly correlated with favorable age, stage, MYCN status, histology, ploidy, risk group, and outcome (P{\textless}0.0001 for all). However, it did not add significantly to the panel of prognostic variables currently used for cooperative group trials. NTRK2 expression was associated with risk factors but not with outcome. High NGF expression was also associated with most risk factors and weakly with unfavorable outcome. Conclusions: High expression of NTRK1 is strongly associated with favorable risk factors and outcome in a large, representative population of NB patients. It did not add significantly to the current risk prediction algorithm, but it may contribute to future expression classifiers. Indeed, prospective assessment of NTRK1 and NTRK2 expression will identify tumors that would be candidates for NTRK-targeted therapy, either alone or in combination with conventional agents. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..},

abstract = {The clinical outcome of microsurgical repair of an injured peripheral nerve with an autograft is suboptimal. A key question addressed here is: can axon regeneration through an autograft be further improved? In this article the impact of six neurotrophic factors (BDNF, CNTF, GDNF, NGF, NT3 or VEGF) on axon regeneration was compared after delivery to a 1. cm long nerve autograft by gene therapy. To distinguish between early and late effects, regeneration was assessed at 2 and 20. weeks post-surgery by histological, electrophysiological and functional analysis. BDNF, GDNF and NGF exhibited a spectrum of effects, including early stimulatory effects on axons entering the autograft and excessive axon growth and Schwann cell proliferation at 20. weeks post-surgery. Persistent expression of these factors in autografts interfered with target cell reinnervation and functional recovery in a modality specific way. Autografts overexpressing VEGF displayed hypervascularization, while grafts transduced with CNTF and NT3 were indistinguishable from control grafts. These three factors did not have detectable pro-regenerative effects. In conclusion, autograft-based repair combined with gene therapy for three of the six growth factors investigated (BDNF, GDNF, NGF) showed considerable promise since these factors enhanced modality specific axon outgrowth in autografts. The remarkable and selective effects of BDNF, GDNF and NGF on motor or sensory regeneration will be exploited in future experiments that aim to carefully regulate their temporal and spatial expression since this has the potential to overcome the adverse effects on long-distance regeneration observed after uncontrolled delivery. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Increasing evidence suggests a new mechanism by which miRNAs may regulate target gene expression by binding in promoter and amino acid coding regions. Most of the existing databases on miRNAs are restricted to mRNA 3'-UTR region. To address this issue, we present miRWalk, a comprehensive database on miRNAs, which hosts predicted as well as validated miRNA binding sites, information on all known genes of human, mouse and rat.All mRNAs, mitochondrial genes and 10. kb upstream flanking regions of all known genes of human, mouse and rat were analyzed by using a newly developed algorithm named 'miRWalk' as well as with eight already established programs for putative miRNA binding sites. An automated and extensive text-mining search was performed on PubMed database to extract validated information on miRNAs. Combined information was put into a MySQL database.miRWalk presents predicted and validated information on miRNA-target interaction. Such a resource enables researchers to validate new targets of miRNA not only on 3'-UTR, but also on the other regions of all known genes. The 'Validated Target module' is updated every month and the 'Predicted Target module' is updated every 6. months. miRWalk is freely available at http://mirwalk.uni-hd.de/. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The regulative effects of microRNAs (miRNAs) on responses of Schwann cells to a nerve injury stimulus are not yet clear. In this study, we noted that the expression of eight miRNAs was downregulated at different time points following rat sciatic nerve transection, and found that 368 potential targets of these eight miRNAs were mainly involved in phenotypic modulation of Schwann cells. Of these miRNAs, miR-9 was identified as an important functional regulator of Schwann cell migration that was a crucial regenerative response of Schwann cells to nerve injury. In vitro, upregulated expression of miR-9 inhibited Schwann cell migration, whereas silencing of miR-9 promoted Schwann cell migration. Intriguingly, miR-9 exerted this regulative function by directly targeting collagen triple helix repeat containing protein 1 (CTHRC1), which in turn inactivated downstream Rac1 GTPase. Rac1 inhibitor reduced the promotive effects of anti-miR-9 on Schwann cell migration. In vivo, high expression of miR-9 reduced Schwann cell migration within a regenerative nerve microenvironment. Collectively, our results confirmed the role of miR-9 in regulating Schwann cell migration after nerve injury, thus offering a new approach to peripheral nerve repair. {\textcopyright} 2014.

Here we report an unconventional role of extracellular miRNAs for rapid excitation of nociceptor neurons via toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) and its coupling to TRPA1 ion channel. miRNA-let-7b induces rapid inward currents and action potentials in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. These responses require the GUUGUGU motif, only occur in neurons coexpressing TLR7 and TRPA1, and are abolished in mice lacking Tlr7 or Trpa1. Furthermore, let-7b induces TLR7/TRPA1-dependent single-channel activities in DRG neurons and HEK293 cells overexpressing TLR7/TRPA1. Intraplantar injection of let-7b elicits rapid spontaneous pain via TLR7 and TRPA1. Finally, let-7b can be released from DRG neurons by neuronal activation, and let-7b inhibitor reduces formalin-induced TRPA1 currents and spontaneous pain. Thus, secreted extracellular miRNAs may serve as novel pain mediators via activating TLR7/TRPA1 in nociceptor neurons. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Chronic pain is a debilitating syndrome caused by a variety of disorders, and represents a major clinical problem because of the lack of adequate medication. In chronic pain, massive changes in gene expression are observed in a variety of cells, including neurons and glia, in the overall somatosensory system from the sensory ganglia to the higher central nervous system. The protein expressions of hundreds of genes are thought to be post-transcriptionally regulated by a single type of microRNA in a sequence-specific manner. Recently, critical roles of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of chronic pain have been emerging. Genome-wide screenings of microRNA expression changes have been reported in a variety of painful conditions, including peripheral nerve injury, inflammatory diseases, cancer and spinal cord injury. The data obtained suggest that a wide range of microRNAs change their expressions in individual pain conditions, although the pathological significance of individual microRNAs as causal mediators in distinct pain conditions remains to be revealed for a limited number of microRNAs. Insights into the roles of microRNAs in chronic pain will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain and allow prompt therapeutic application of microRNA-related drugs against intractable persistent pain.},

MicroRNA-214 was predicted to target the 3′-untranslated region of Slit-Robo GTPase-activating protein 3. In situ hybridization verified that microRNA-214 was located in the cytoplasm of dorsal root ganglia primary neurons and was downregulated following sciatic nerve transection. Moreover, a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that microRNA-214 and Slit-Robo GTPase-activating protein 3 were co-localized in dorsal root ganglion primary neurons. Western blot analysis suggested that Slit-Robo GTPase-activating protein 3 was upregulated in dorsal root ganglion neurons after sciatic nerve transection. These data demonstrate that microRNA-214 is located and differentially expressed in dorsal root ganglion primary neurons and may participate in regulating the gene expression of Slit-Robo GTPase-activating protein 3 after sciatic nerve transection.},

abstract = {Peripheral nerve injury alters the expression of hundreds of proteins in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Targeting some of these proteins has led to successful treatments for acute pain, but not for sustained post-operative neuropathic pain. The latter may require targeting multiple proteins. Since a single microRNA (miR) can affect the expression of multiple proteins, here, we describe an approach to identify chronic neuropathic pain-relevant miRs. We used two variants of the spared nerve injury (SNI): Sural-SNI and Tibial-SNI and found distinct pain phenotypes between the two. Both models induced strong mechanical allodynia, but only Sural-SNI rats maintained strong mechanical and cold allodynia, as previously reported. In contrast, we found that Tibial-SNI rats recovered from mechanical allodynia and never developed cold allodynia. Since both models involve nerve injury, we increased the probability of identifying differentially regulated miRs that correlated with the quality and magnitude of neuropathic pain and decreased the probability of detecting miRs that are solely involved in neuronal regeneration. We found seven such miRs in L3-L5 DRG. The expression of these miRs increased in Tibial-SNI. These miRs displayed a lower level of expression in Sural-SNI, with four having levels lower than those in sham animals. Bioinformatic analysis of how these miRs could affect the expression of some ion channels supports the view that, following a peripheral nerve injury, the increase of the seven miRs may contribute to the recovery from neuropathic pain while the decrease of four of them may contribute to the development of chronic neuropathic pain. The approach used resulted in the identification of a small number of potentially neuropathic pain relevant miRs. Additional studies are required to investigate whether manipulating the expression of the identified miRs in primary sensory neurons can prevent or ameliorate chronic neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injuries.},

abstract = {Peripheral nerve injury is a common clinical problem. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes peripheral nerve regeneration, but its clinical applications are limited by several constraints. In this study, we found that the time-dependent expression profiles of eight let-7 family members in the injured nerve after sciatic nerve injury were roughly similar to each other. Let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly reduced cell proliferation and migration of primary Schwann cells (SCs) by directly targeting NGF and suppressing its protein translation. Following sciatic nerve injury, the temporal change in let-7 miRNA expression was negatively correlated with that in NGF expression. Inhibition of let-7 miRNAs increased NGF secretion by primary cultured SCs and enhanced axonal outgrowth from a coculture of primary SCs and dorsal root gangalion neurons. In vivo tests indicated that let-7 inhibition promoted SCs migration and axon outgrowth within a regenerative microenvironment. In addition, the inhibitory effect of let-7 miRNAs on SCs apoptosis might serve as an early stress response to nerve injury, but this effect seemed to be not mediated through a NGF-dependent pathway. Collectively, our results provide a new insight into let-7 miRNA regulation of peripheral nerve regeneration and suggest a potential therapy for repair of peripheral nerve injury.},

Progress in science and technology has enabled development of these three factors, with basic research being applied clinically. In the past decade, we have investigated tissue regeneration in animal models of musculoskeletal disorders by using cells, scaffold, and delivery systems which has been relatively easy to apply and develop in clinical settings. Moreover, microRNA (miRNA), which are important in biological processes and in the pathogenesis of human diseases, have been used in research on regenerative medicine. For the cell source, we focused on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and CD34+ and CD133+ cells as endothelial progenitor cells for regeneration of musculoskeletal organs. These cells are accessible and safe. For less invasive and more effective therapy, we developed a novel cell-delivery system using magnetic force to accumulate cells at a desired site. Furthermore, administration of synthetic miRNA could enhance tissue regeneration. In our studies, use of these cells combined with a cell-delivery system, miRNA, scaffold, and cytokines has led to effective regeneration of musculoskeletal tissues including cartilage, bone, ligaments, muscle, peripheral nerves, and spinal cord. The current and future objective is more effective and less invasive cell-based therapy with spatial control of transplanted cells by use of an external magnetic force. Analysis of efficiency, safety, and the mechanism of tissue regeneration by cells, scaffold, and miRNA will lead to more promising regenerative medicine, involving the development of a new generation of therapy.

abstract = {The efficacy of radiotherapy in many tumor types is limited by normal tissue toxicity and by intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular network responsible for regulating radiosensitivity/resistance. Here, an unbiased functional screen identified four microRNAs (miR1, miR125a, miR150, and miR425) that induce radioresistance. Considering the clinical importance of radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma, the impact of these miRNAs on glioblastoma radioresistance was investigated. Overexpression of miR1, miR125a, miR150, and/or miR425 in glioblastoma promotes radioresistance through upregulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint response. Conversely, antagonizing with antagomiRs sensitizes glioblastoma cells to irradiation, suggesting their potential as targets for inhibiting therapeutic resistance. Analysis of glioblastoma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that these miRNAs are expressed in glioblastoma patient specimens and correlate with TGFb signaling. Finally, it is demonstrated that expression of miR1 and miR125a can be induced by TGFb and antagonized by a TGFb receptor inhibitor. Together, these results identify and characterize a new role for miR425, miR1, miR125, and miR150 in promoting radioresistance in glioblastomas and provide insight into the therapeutic application of TGFb inhibitors in radiotherapy.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that regulate target gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Here, we report that secreted miRNAs can serve as signaling molecules mediating intercellular communication. In human blood cells and cultured THP-1 cells, miR-150 was selectively packaged into microvesicles (MVs) and actively secreted. THP-1-derived MVs can enter and deliver miR-150 into human HMEC-1 cells, and elevated exogenous miR-150 effectively reduced c-Myb expression and enhanced cell migration in HMEC-1 cells. In vivo studies confirmed that intravenous injection of THP-1 MVs significantly increased the level of miR-150 in mouse blood vessels. MVs isolated from the plasma of patients with atherosclerosis contained higher levels of miR-150, and they more effectively promoted HMEC-1 cell migration than MVs from healthy donors. These results demonstrate that cells can secrete miRNAs and deliver them into recipient cells where the exogenous miRNAs can regulate target gene expression and recipient cell function. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Improved approaches for the detection of common epithelial malignancies are urgently needed to reduce the worldwide morbidity and mortality caused by cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (≈22 nt) regulatory RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. We show here that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. miRNAs originating from human prostate cancer xenografts enter the circulation, are readily measured in plasma, and can robustly distinguish xenografted mice from controls. This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of miR-141 (a miRNA expressed in prostate cancer) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls. Our results establish the measurement of tumor-derived miRNAs in serum or plasma as an important approach for the blood-based detection of human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {In the past few years, the crucial role of different micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in the cardiovascular system has been widely recognized. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the bloodstream and that such circulating miRNAs are remarkably stable. This has raised the possibility that miRNAs may be probed in the circulation and can serve as novel diagnostic markers. Although the precise cellular release mechanisms of miRNAs remain largely unknown, the first studies revealed that these circulating miRNAs may be delivered to recipient cells, where they can regulate translation of target genes. In this review, we will discuss the nature of the stability of miRNAs that circulate in the bloodstream and discuss the available evidence regarding the possible function of these circulating miRNAs in distant cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, we summarize and discuss the usefulness of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Background The development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is multifactorial with a number of biomarkers serving as mediators of neurohormonal activation [B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its N-terminal-pro-fragment (NT-proBNP)], endothelial dysfunction [asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)] and cellular proliferation [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)]. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature for trials studying the role of these biomarkers in the clinical evaluation, prognosis and management of patients with PAH related to CHD (CHD-PAH). Results Twenty-six studies were included in the systematic review, involving a total of 1113 patients with CHD-PAH. These patients had higher BNP, NT-proBNP and ADMA levels and higher VEGF expression when compared with healthy controls. Baseline and serial values of plasma levels of natriuretic peptides were shown to be significant predictors of survival. ADMA concentration was elevated in patients with CHD-PAH when compared with patients with simple CHD without PAH, whereas VEGF expression was particularly high in patients with CHD and persistent PAH after corrective surgery of the underlying heart disease. Conclusion Right heart dysfunction, endothelial inflammation and proliferation are mirrored by plasma levels of the corresponding biomarkers among patients with CHD-PAH. There is early evidence to suggest that natriuretic peptides, in particular, may be a simple and effective tool for determining prognosis and timing for therapeutic interventions in patients with CHD-PAH. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {In their natural habitat, the peripheral nerve, Schwann cells (SCs) form nicely aligned pathways (also known as the bands of B{\"{u}} ngner) that guide regenerating axons to their targets. Schwann cells that are implanted in the lesioned spinal cord fail to align in pathways that could support axon growth but form cellular clusters that exhibit only limited intermingling with the astrocytes and meningeal cells (MCs) that are present in the neural scar. The formation of cell clusters can be studied in cocultures of SCs and MCs. In these co-cultures SCs form cluster-like non-overlapping cell aggregates with well-defined boundaries. There are several indications that neuropilins (NRPs) play an important role in MC-induced SC aggregation. Both SCs and MCs express NRP1 and NRP2 and SCs express the NRP ligands Sema3B, C and E while MCs express Sema3A, C, E and F. We now demonstrate that in SC-MC co-cultures, siRNA mediated knockdown of NRP2 in SCs decreased the formation of SC clusters while these SCs maintained their capacity to align in bands of B{\"{u}}ngner-like columnar arrays. Unexpectedly, knockdown of NRP1 expression resulted in a significant increase in SC aggregation. These results suggest that a reduction in NRP2 expression may enhance the capacity of implanted SCs to interact with MCs that invade a neural scar formed after a lesion of the spinal cord.},

These orchestrated events regulate the degeneration and subsequent regeneration of the injured nerve. In addition, peripheral nerve injury often accompanies chronic pain. Studies in this field have revealed that spinal cord microglia activation plays a critical role in the development of pain hypersensitivity. Recent studies using genetically modified mice indicate that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration) and chronic pain (neuropathic pain) development after nerve injury. Here, we review studies that have implicated TLRs in mediating nerve degeneration/regeneration and neuropathic pain following nerve injury. In addition, we discuss possible mechanisms underlying the roles of TLRs in these neurological disorders. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Neuronal and glial proteins detected in the peripheral circulating blood after injury can reflect the extent of the damage caused by blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI). The temporal pattern of their serum levels can further predict the severity and outcome of the injury. As part of characterizing a large-animal model of bTBI, we determined the changes in the serum levels of S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), myelin basic protein (MBP), and neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H). Blood samples were obtained prior to injury and at 6, 24, 72 h, and 2 weeks post-injury from animals with different severities of bTBI; protein levels were determined using reverse phase protein microarray (RPPM) technology. Serum levels of S100B, MBP, and NF-H, but not NSE, showed a time-dependent increase following injury. The detected changes in S100B and MBP levels showed no correlation with the severity of the injury. However, serum NF-H levels increased in a unique, rapid manner, peaking at 6 h post-injury only in animals exposed to severe blast with poor clinical and pathological outcomes. We conclude that the sudden increase in serum NF-H levels following bTBI may be a useful indicator of injury severity. If additional studies verify our findings, the observed early peak of serum NF-H levels can be developed into a useful diagnostic tool for predicting the extent of damage following bTBI. {\textcopyright} 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Unlike most invertebrates, annelids possess a closed vascular system distinct from the coelomic liquid. The morphology and the function of leech blood cells are reported here. We have demonstrated the presence of a unique cell type which participates in various immune processes. In contrast to the mammalian spinal cord, the leech CNS is able to regenerate and restore function after injury. The close contact of the blood with the nerve cord also led us to explore the participation of blood in neural repair. Our data evidenced that, in addition to exerting peripheral immune functions, leech blood optimizes CNS neural repair through the release of neurotrophic substances. Circulating blood cells also appeared able to infiltrate the injured CNS where, in conjunction with microglia, they limit the formation of a scar. In mammals, CNS injury leads to the generation of a glial scar that blocks the mechanism of regeneration by preventing axonal regrowth. The results presented here constitute the first description of neuroimmune functions of invertebrate blood cells. Understanding the basic function of the peripheral circulating cells and their interactions with lesioned CNS in the leech would allow us to acquire insights into the complexity of the neuroimmune response of the injured mammalian brain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Basel AG.},

abstract = {Subsequent to peripheral nerve compression and irritation, pathophysiological processes take place within nervous and immune systems. Here, we utilized a multimodal approach to comprehend peripheral and central soft tissue changes as well as alterations occurring in systemic analytes following unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rodents. Using magnetic resonance imaging and [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, we demonstrated robust structural abnormalities and enhanced FDG uptake within the injured nerve and surrounding muscle, respectively. To assess whether central morphological changes were induced by nerve injury, diffusion tenor imaging was performed. A decrease in fractional anisotropy in primary motor cortex contralateral to the injury site was observed. Evaluation of a panel of circulating cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors showed decreased levels of interleukin-1$\beta$ and Fractalkine in CCI animals. Area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) calculations of analyte levels, imaging, and behavioral end points ranged from 0.786 to 1, where behavioral and peripheral imaging end points (eg, FDG uptake in muscle) were observed to have the highest discriminatory capabilities (maximum area under ROC = 1) between nerve injury and sham conditions. Lastly, performance of correlation analysis involving all analyte, behavioral, and imaging data provided an understanding of the overall association amongst these end points, and importantly, a distinction in correlation patterns was observed between CCI and sham conditions. These findings demonstrate the multidimensional pathophysiology of sciatic nerve injury and how a combined analyte, behavioral, and imaging assessment can be implemented to probe this complexity.},

abstract = {Promoting neuromuscular recovery after neural injury is a major clinical issue. While techniques for nerve reconstruction are continuously improving and most peripheral nerve lesions can be repaired today, recovery of the lost function is usually unsatisfactory. This evidence claims for innovative nonsurgical therapeutic strategies that can implement the outcome after neural repair.Although no pharmacological approach for improving posttraumatic neuromuscular recovery has still entered clinical practice, various molecules are explored in experimental models of neural repair. One of such molecules is the circulating peptide hormone ghrelin. This hormone has proved to have a positive effect on neural repair after central nervous system lesion, and very recently its effectiveness has also been demonstrated in preventing posttraumatic skeletal muscle atrophy. By contrast, no information is still available about its effectiveness on peripheral nerve regeneration although preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that this molecule can have an effect also in promoting axonal regeneration after nerve injury and repair.Should this be confirmed, ghrelin might represent an ideal candidate as a therapeutic agent for improving posttraumatic neuromuscular recovery because of its putative effects at all the various structural levels involved in this regeneration process, namely, the central nervous system, the peripheral nerve, and the target skeletal muscle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Pre-clinical animal models are critical for testing nerve scaffolds prior to implementation in clinical practice. We have conducted a systematic review of 416 reports in which animal models were used for evaluation of nerve regeneration into synthetic conduits. A valid animal model of nerve regeneration requires it to reproduce the specific processes that take place in regeneration after human peripheral nerve injury. No distinct animal species meets all the requirements for an ideal animal model. Certain models are well suited for understanding regenerative neurobiology while others are better for pre-clinical evaluation of efficacy. The review identified that more than 70 synthetic materials were tested in eight species using 17 different nerves. Nerve gaps ranged from 1 to 90 mm. More than 20 types of assessment methodology were used with no standardization of methods between any of the publications. The review emphasizes the urgent need for standardization or rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying nerve repair. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Motoneurons preferentially reinnervate the motor branch in juveniles and adults, even if the repair is intentionally misaligned or a gap is imposed between proximal and distal stumps. A specific interaction thus occurs between regenerating motor axons and the Schwann cell tubes that lead to the motor branch. This interaction is independent of mechanical axon alignment.},

It is now recognized that neurotransmitter-mediated signalling has a key role in regulating cerebral blood flow, that much of this control is mediated by astrocytes, that oxygen modulates blood flow regulation, and that blood flow may be controlled by capillaries as well as by arterioles. These conceptual shifts in our understanding of cerebral blood flow control have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Injury to the nervous system causes the almost immediate release of cytokines by glial cells and neurons. These cytokines orchestrate a complex array of responses leading to microgliosis, immune cell recruitment, astrogliosis, scarring, and the clearance of cellular debris, all steps that affect neuronal survival and repair. This review will focus on cytokines released after spinal cord and peripheral nerve injury and the primary signalling pathways triggered by these inflammatory mediators. Notably, the following cytokine families will be covered: IL-1, TNF, IL-6-like, TGF-$\beta$, and IL-10. Whether interfering with cytokine signalling could lead to novel therapies will also be discussed. Finally, the review will address whether manipulating the above-mentioned cytokine families and signalling pathways could exert distinct effects in the injured spinal cord versus peripheral nerve. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Cahill2014,
abstract = {Background: Genetic polymorphisms, gender and age all influence the risk of developing chronic neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury (PNI). It is known that there are significant inter-strain differences in pain hypersensitivity in strains of mice after PNI. In response to PNI, one of the earliest events is thought to be the disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). The study of BSCB integrity after PNI may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to chronic pain.Results: Here we used in vivo dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to establish a timecourse for BSCB permeability following PNI, produced by performing a spared nerve injury (SNI). From this longitudinal study, we found that the SNI group had a significant increase in BSCB permeability over time throughout the entire spinal cord. The BSCB opening had a delayed onset and the increase in permeability was transient, returning to control levels just over one day after the surgery. We also examined inter-strain differences in BSCB permeability using five mouse strains (B10, C57BL/6J, CD-1, A/J and BALB/c) that spanned the range of pain hypersensitivity. We found a significant increase in BSCB permeability in the SNI group that was dependent on strain but that did not correlate with the reported strain differences in PNI-induced tactile hypersensitivity. These results were consistent with a previous experiment using Evans Blue dye to independently assess the status of the BSCB permeability.Conclusions: DCE-MRI provides a sensitive and non-invasive method to follow BSCB permeability in the same group of mice over time. Examining differences between mouse strains, we demonstrated that there is an important genetically-based control of the PNI-induced increase in BSCB permeability and that the critical genetic determinants of BSCB opening after PNI are distinct from those that determine genetic variability in PNI-induced pain hypersensitivity.},

abstract = {Object. Despite the negative effects of peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) on long-term population health, their true prevalence among pediatric trauma patients is under debate. The authors investigated the prevalence of PNIs among children involved in trauma and investigated associations between PNIs and several patient characteristics. Methods. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric trauma patients who were registered in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2009 through 2011 and who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. They used regression techniques to investigate the association of demographic and socioeconomic factors with the rate of PNIs among these patients. Results. Of the 245,470 study patients, 50,211 were involved in motor vehicle crashes, 3380 in motorcycle crashes, 20,491 in bicycle crashes, 18,262 in pedestrian accidents, 26,294 in other crashes (mainly involving allterrain vehicles and snowmobiles), and 126,832 in falls. The respective prevalence of PNIs was 0.66{\%} for motor vehicle crashes, 1{\%} for motorcycle crashes, 0.38{\%} for bicycle crashes, 0.42{\%} for pedestrian accidents, 0.79{\%} for other crashes, and 0.52{\%} for falls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the following were associated with an increased incidence of PNIs: increased patient age (OR 1.10, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.20), higher Injury Severity Score (OR 1.10, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.20), elevated systolic blood pressure at arrival at the emergency room (OR 1.10, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.20), and increased number of trauma surgeons at the institution (OR 1.10, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.20). The following were associated with lower incidence of PNIs: female sex (OR 0.94, 95{\%} CI 0.87-1.02), rural hospitals (OR 0.94, 95{\%} CI 0.87-1.02), and urban nonteaching hospitals (OR 0.94, 95{\%} CI 0.87-1.02). Conclusions. PNIs are more common than previously identified for the pediatric trauma population. These injuries are associated with older age and increased severity of the overall injury.},

abstract = {Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is clinically heterogenic. Biomarkers are needed to predict prognosis and guide management. We aimed to profile microRNA (miRNA) in ADPKD to gain molecular insight and evaluate biomarker potential. Methods: Small-RNA libraries were generated from urine specimens of ADPKD patients (N = 20) and patients with chronic kidney disease of other etiologies (CKD, N = 20). In this report, we describe the miRNA profiles and baseline characteristics. For reference, we also examined the miRNA transcriptome in primary cultures of ADPKD cyst epithelia (N = 10), normal adult tubule (N = 8) and fetal tubule (N = 7) epithelia. Results: In primary cultures of ADPKD kidney cells, miRNA cistrons mir-143(2) (9.2-fold), let-7i(1) (2.3-fold) and mir-3619(1) (12.1-fold) were significantly elevated compared to normal tubule epithelia, whereas mir-1(4) members (19.7-fold), mir- 133b(2) (21.1-fold) and mir-205(1) (3.0-fold) were downregulated (P{\textless}0.01). Expression of the dysregulated miRNA in fetal tubule epithelia resembled ADPKD better than normal adult cells, except let-7i, which was lower in fetal cells. In patient biofluid specimens, mir-143(2) members were 2.9-fold higher in urine cells from ADPKD compared to other CKD patients, while expression levels of mir-133b(2) (4.9-fold) and mir-1(4) (4.4-fold) were lower in ADPKD. We also noted increased abundance mir-223(1) (5.6-fold), mir-199a(3) (1.4-fold) and mir-199b(1) (1.8-fold) (P{\textless}0.01) in ADPKD urine cells. In ADPKD urine microvesicles, miR-1(2) (7.2-fold) and miR-133a(2) (11.8-fold) were less abundant compared to other CKD patients (P{\textless}0.01). Conclusions: We found that in ADPKD urine specimens, miRNA previously implicated as kidney tumor suppressors (miR-1 and miR-133), as well as miRNA of presumed inflammatory and fibroblast cell origin (miR-223/miR-199), are dysregulated when compared to other CKD patients. Concordant with findings in the primary tubule epithelial cell model, this suggests roles for dysregulated miRNA in ADPKD pathogenesis and potential use as biomarkers. We intend to assess prognostic potential of miRNA in a followup analysis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ben-Dov et al.},

abstract = {We present a new model for documentation and quantification of the functional outcome after nerve repair at the wrist or distal forearm level and a protocol that includes a numerical scoring system. The model, presented here along with validation and reliability test results, supports our hypothesis that the summarized test results reflecting specific functional limitations correlates well with the patient's opinion of the impact of the nerve injury on activities of daily living. Seventy patients with nerve repair were examined using the protocol. Analysis included 3 factors: sensory domain (sensory innervation, tactile gnosis, and finger dexterity), motor domain (motor innervation and grip strength), and pain/discomfort domain (hyperaesthesia and cold intolerance). The analysis explained 73{\%} of the variances of the variables and the variables had a logical distribution between the factors. Analysis of internal consistency demonstrated good homogeneity. A calculated total score correlated strongly with the patients' global estimation of the impact of the injury on activities of daily living and the summary of sensory and pain/discomfort domains correlated significantly with the Medical Research Council S0-S4 scale. The presented model represents a useful new tool for evaluation of the functional outcome after nerve injury and repair. {\textcopyright} 2000 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

abstract = {Molecular diagnostics of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD-PKD) relies on mutation screening of PKD1 and PKD2, which is complicated by extensive allelic heterogeneity and the presence of six highly homologous sequences of PKD1. To date, specific sequencing of PKD1 requires laborious long-range amplifications. The high cost and long turnaround time of PKD1 and PKD2 mutation analysis using conventional techniques limits its widespread application in clinical settings. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PKD1 and PKD2. Pooled barcoded DNA patient libraries were enriched by in-solution hybridization with PKD1 and PKD2 capture probes. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using an in-house developed pipeline. We validated the assay in a cohort of 36 patients with previously known PKD1 and PKD2 mutations and five control individuals. Then, we used the same assay and bioinformatics analysis in a discovery cohort of 12 unchar-acterized patients. We detected 35 out of 36 known definitely, highly likely, and likely pathogenic mutations in the validation cohort, including two large deletions. In the discovery cohort, we detected 11 different pathogenic mutations in 10 out of 12 patients. This study demonstrates that laborious long-range PCRs of the repeated PKD1 region can be avoided by in-solution enrichment of PKD1 and PKD2 and NGS. This strategy significantly reduces the cost and time for simultaneous PKD1 and PKD2 sequence analysis, facilitating routine genetic diagnostics of ADPKD.},

abstract = {Background. Although autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 2 (PKD2) is known to have a milder clinical phenotype than PKD1, neither disorder has been compared with an unaffected control population in terms of survival. We report the findings of a multicentre survey that aimed to define more precisely the survival and clinical expression of PKD1 and PKD2. Methods. Clinical data from 333 people with PKD1 (31 families) were compared with data from 291 people with PKD2 (31 families) and 398 geographically matched controls. Survival analysis was used to compare age-at-event data. Differences in the prevalence of complications were assessed by logistic regression. Findings. Median age at death or onset of end-stage renal disease was 53.0 years (95{\%} CI 51.2-54.8) in individuals with PKD1, 69.1 years (66.9-71.3) in those with PKD2, and 78.0 years (73.8-82.2) in controls. Women with PKD2 had a significantly longer median survival than men (71.0 [67.4-74.8] vs 67.3 [64.9-69.7] years), but no sex influence was apparent in PKD1. Age at presentation with kidney failure was later in PKD2 than in PKD1 (median age 74.0 [67.2-80.8] vs 54.3 [52.7-55.9] years). PKD2 patients were less likely to have hypertension (odds ratio 0.25 [95{\%} CI 0.15-0.42]), a history of urinary-tract infection (0.50 [0.31-0.83]), or haematuria (0.59 [0.35-0.98]). Interpretation. Although PKD2 is clinically milder than PKD1, it has a deleterious impact on overall life expectancy and cannot be regarded as a benign disorder.},

abstract = {Background. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth most common renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Still, there are few epidemiological data on the prevalence of, and survival on RRT for ADPKD. Methods. This study used data from the ERA-EDTA Registry on RRT prevalence and survival on RRT in 12 European countries with 208 million inhabitants. We studied four 5-year periods (1991-2010). Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and by Cox proportional hazards regression. Results. From the first to the last study period, the prevalence of RRT for ADPKD increased from 56.8 to 91.1 per million population (pmp). The percentage of prevalent RRT patients with ADPKD remained fairly stable at 9.8{\%}. Two-year survival of ADPKD patients on RRT (adjusted for age, sex and country) increased significantly from 89.0 to 92.8{\%}, and was higher than for non-ADPKD subjects. Improved survival was noted for all RRT modalities: haemodialysis [adjusted hazard ratio for mortality during the last versus first time period 0.75 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.61-0.91), peritoneal dialysis 0.55 (0.38-0.80) and transplantation 0.52 (0.32-0.74)]. Cardiovascular mortality as a proportion of total mortality on RRT decreased more in ADPKD patients (from 53 to 29{\%}), than in non-ADPKD patients (from 44 to 35{\%}). Of note, the incidence rate of RRT for ADPKD remained relatively stable at 7.6 versus 8.3 pmp from the first to the last study period, which will be discussed in detail in a separate study. Conclusions. In ADPKD patients on RRT, survival has improved markedly, especially due to a decrease in cardiovascular mortality. This has led to a considerable increase in the number of ADPKD patients being treated with RRT.},

abstract = {Results General population incidence ratios in 2009-2010 were unchanged from 2001-2002 (incidence ratio, 1.02). Of patients with ADPKD, 48.1{\%} received more than 12 months of nephrology care before RRT; preemptive transplantation was the initial RRT in 14.3{\%} and fistula was the initial hemodialysis access in 35.8{\%}. During 4.9 years of follow-up, patients with ADPKD were more likely to be listed for transplantation (IR, 11.7 [95{\%} CI, 11.5-12.0] vs 8.4 [95{\%} CI, 8.2-8.7] per 100 person-years) and to undergo transplantation (IR, 9.8 [95{\%} CI, 9.5-10.0] vs 4.8 [95{\%} CI, 4.7-5.0] per 100 person-years) and less likely to die (IR, 5.6 [95{\%} CI, 5.4-5.7] vs 15.5 [95{\%} CI, 15.3-15.8] per 100 person-years) than matched controls without ADPKD.
Limitations Retrospective nonexperimental registry-based study of associations; cause-and-effect relationships cannot be determined.
Conclusions Although outcomes on dialysis therapy are better for patients with ADPKD than for those without ADPKD, access to predialysis nephrology care and nondeclining ESRD rates may be a cause for concern.
Background Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is amenable to early detection and specialty care. Thus, while important to patients with the condition, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from ADPKD also may be an indicator of the overall state of nephrology care.
Study Design Retrospective cohort study of temporal trends in ESRD from ADPKD and pre-renal replacement therapy (RRT) nephrologist care, 2001-2010 (n = 23,772).
Setting {\&} Participants US patients who initiated maintenance RRT from 2001 through 2010 (n = 1,069,343) from US Renal Data System data.
Predictor ESRD from ADPKD versus from other causes for baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes; interval 2001-2005 versus 2006-2010 for comparisons of cohort of patients with ESRD from ADPKD.

abstract = {Between January 1, 1935 and December 31, 1980, adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) was diagnosed in 40 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, resulting in an ageand sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 1.38/100,000 person-years. In addition, 16 cases were detected at autopsy, increasing the rate to 2.06. It is estimated that 16 additional cases would have been discovered had all deaths come to autopsy, resulting in a rate of 2.75, or approximately twice the incidence rate of cases diagnosed during life . Because of improvements in medical care and diagnostic techniques, APKD has been diagnosed earlier and more frequently in the recent decades. This, along with therapeutic advances, explains the improvement in kidney and patient survival for the patients diagnosed during 1956–1980, as compared to those diagnosed during 1935-1955. Normotension at diagnosis tended to be associated with better kidney and/or patient survival. Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death. {\textcopyright} 1983, National Kidney Foundation, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with an overall oneyear mortality of 23.5{\%} in the US, of which cardiac causes constitute 50{\%} of all deaths. Data on incident ESRD patients were obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration's 2728 and 2746 forms by special request from the ESRD Network of New York. 4948 ESRD patients, who started dialysis in New York State from April 1, 1995, through April 1, 1996, were assessed to identify risk factors present at the initiation of dialysis that predict cardiac death. 899 deaths were registered during the 19-month-follow-up period, 50{\%} of which were from cardiac causes. Using the Cox-proportional hazards model, the increasing age category, white race, the presence of one or more vascular co-morbid conditions, and the presence of diabetes and one or more cardiac co-morbid conditions significantly predicted cardiac death (p {\textless} 0.05). Diabetes increased the risk for cardiac death by 48{\%} for those patients without any cardiac co-morbidities (RR = 1.48, p {\textless} 0.0082). In contrast with results observed in the general population, gender, serum albumin and body mass index were not significant predictors of cardiac death. In identifying risk factors present at the initiation of dialysis that predict cardiac death, this study highlights factors that may be modified prior to dialysis initiation in order to improve life expectancy and mortality rates and decrease health care costs for the ESRD population.},

abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is typically a late-onset disease caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2, but about 2{\%} of patients with ADPKD show an early and severe phenotype that can be clinically indistinguishable from autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The high recurrence risk in pedigrees with early and severe PKD strongly suggests a common familial modifying background, but the mechanisms underlying the extensive phenotypic variability observed among affected family members remain unknown. Here, we describe severely affected patients with PKD who carry, in addition to their expected familial germ-line defect, additional mutations in PKD genes, including HNF-1$\beta$, which likely aggravate the phenotype. Our findings are consistent with a common pathogenesis and dosage theory for PKD and may propose a general concept for the modification of disease expression in other so-called monogenic disorders.

abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited kidney disorder, is characterized by the progressive development and expansion of bilateral fluid-filled cysts derived from the renal tubule epithelial cells. Although typically leading to end-stage renal disease in late middle age, ADPKD represents a continuum, from neonates with hugely enlarged cystic kidneys to cases with adequate kidney function into old age. Since the identification of the first causative gene (i.e., PKD1, encoding polycystin 1) 20 years ago, genetic studies have uncovered a large part of the key factors that underlie the phenotype variability. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these significant advances as well as those related to disease pathogenesis models, including mutation analysis of PKD1 and PKD2 (encoding polycystin 2), current mutation detection rate, allelic heterogeneity, genotype and phenotype relationships (in terms of three different inheritance patterns: classical autosomal dominant inheritance, complex inheritance, and somatic and germline mosaicism), modifier genes, the role of second somatic mutation hit in renal cystogenesis, and findings from mouse models of polycystic kidney disease. Based upon a combined consideration of the current knowledge, we attempted to propose a unifying framework for explaining the phenotype variability in ADPKD. ADPKD (Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease) is characterized by the development of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. Half of the patients developed end-stage renal disease before the age of 65. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent advances in the genetics and pathogenesis of ADPKD.},

@article{Harris2010,
abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common nephropathy caused by mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2. Mutations in PKD1 account for ∼85{\%} of cases and cause more severe disease than mutations in PKD2. Diagnosis of ADPKD before the onset of symptoms is usually performed using renal imaging by either ultrasonography, CT or MRI. In general, these modalities are reliable for the diagnosis of ADPKD in older individuals. However, molecular testing can be valuable when a definite diagnosis is required in young individuals, in individuals with a negative family history of ADPKD, and to facilitate preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Although linkage-based diagnostic approaches are feasible in large families, direct mutation screening is generally more applicable. As ADPKD displays a high level of allelic heterogeneity, complete screening of both genes is required. Consequently, such screening approaches are expensive. Screening of individuals with ADPKD detects mutations in up to 91{\%} of cases. However, only ∼65{\%} of patients have definite mutations with ∼26{\%} having nondefinite changes that require further evaluation. Collation of known variants in the ADPKD mutation database and systematic scoring of nondefinite variants is increasing the diagnostic value of molecular screening. Genic information can be of prognostic value and recent investigation of hypomorphic PKD1 alleles suggests that allelic information may also be valuable in some atypical cases. In the future, when effective therapies are developed for ADPKD, molecular testing may become increasingly widespread. Rapid developments in DNA sequencing may also revolutionize testing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) evaluated for kidney transplantation, issues related to native nephrectomy, cystic liver involvement, screening for intracranial aneurysms and living-related kidney donation deserve special consideration. Prophylactic native nephrectomy is restricted to patients with a history of cyst infection or recurrent haemorrhage or to those in whom space must be made to implant the graft. Patients with liver involvement require pretransplant imaging. Selection of patients for pretransplant screening of intracranial aneurysms should follow the general recommendations for patients with ADPKD. In living related-donor candidates aged {\textless}30 years and at-risk of ADPKD, molecular genetic testing should be carried out when ultrasonography and MRI findings are normal or equivocal. After kidney transplantation, patient and graft survival rates are excellent and the volume of native kidneys decreases. However, liver cysts continue to grow and treatment with a somatostatin analogue should be considered in patients with massive cyst involvement. Cerebrovascular events have a marginal effect on post-transplant morbidity and mortality. An increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus and nonmelanoma skin cancers has been reported, but several studies have challenged these findings. Finally, no data currently support the preferential use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors as immunosuppressive agents in transplant recipients with ADPKD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Reconstructive transplantation has become a viable option to restore form and function after devastating tissue loss. Functional recovery is a key determinant of overall success and critically depends on the quality and pace of nerve regeneration. Several molecular and cellbased therapies have been postulated and tested in preclinical animal models to enhance nerve regeneration. Schwann cells remain the mainstay of research focus providing neurotrophic support and signaling cues forregenerating axons. Alternative cell sources such as mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stromal cells have also been tested in pre-clinical animal models and in clinical trials due to their relative ease of harvest, rapid expansion in vitro, minimal immunogenicity, and capacity to integrate and survive within host tissues, thereby overcoming many of the challenges faced by culturing of human Schwann cells and nerve allografting. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Schwann cells are of particular interest since they can provide abundant, patientspecific autologous Schwann cells. The majority of experimental evidence on cell-based therapies, however, has been generated using stem cell-seeded nerve guides that were developed to enhance nerve regeneration across ‘‘gaps'' in neural repair. Although primary end-to-end repair is the preferred method of neurorrhaphy in reconstructive transplantation, mechanistic studies elucidating the principles of cell-based therapies from nerve guidance conduits will form the foundation of further research employing stem cells in end-to-end repair of donor and recipient nerves. This review presents key components of nerve regeneration in reconstructive transplantation and highlights the pre-clinical studies that utilize stem cells to enhance nerve regeneration.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a set of indicators on survival, life expectancy and causes of death of patients in chronic renal failure treated by dialysis or transplantation beginning a first replacement therapy between 2002 and 2011. Age strongly influences survival on dialysis. Thus, one year survival of patients under age 65 is over 90{\%}. After 5 years, among patients over 85 years, it is more than 15{\%}. The presence of diabetes or one or more cardiovascular comorbidities also significantly worse patient survival. In terms of trend, we do not find significant improvement in the 2-year survival between patients in the cohort 2006-2007 and the 2008-2009 cohort. Cardiovascular diseases account for 27{\%} of causes of death to infectious diseases (12{\%}) and cancer (10{\%}). Life expectancy of patients is highly dependent on their treatment. Thus, a transplant patient aged 30 has a life expectancy of 41 years versus 23 years for a dialysis patient. Transplant patients have a mortality rate much lower than those of dialysis patients. Thus, between 60 and 69 years, for 1000 patients in dialysis in 2011, 127 died within the year. For 1000 patients of the same age, who have a functioning kidney transplant, 24 died within the year. {\textcopyright} 2013 Association Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de N{\'{e}}phrologie.

abstract = {Background: Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between patients' covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems. Methods: We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment recommendations. Results: We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients. Conclusions: The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure.},

abstract = {There is growing recognition that immunotherapy is likely to significantly improve health outcomes for cancer patients in the coming years. Currently, while a subset of patients experience substantial clinical benefit in response to different immunotherapeutic approaches, the majority of patients do not but are still exposed to the significant drug toxicities. Therefore, a growing need for the development and clinical use of predictive biomarkers exists in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Predictive cancer biomarkers can be used to identify the patients who are or who are not likely to derive benefit from specific therapeutic approaches. In order to be applicable in a clinical setting, predictive biomarkers must be carefully shepherded through a step-wise, highly regulated developmental process. Volume I of this two-volume document focused on the pre-analytical and analytical phases of the biomarker development process, by providing background, examples and "good practice" recommendations. In the current Volume II, the focus is on the clinical validation, validation of clinical utility and regulatory considerations for biomarker development. Together, this two volume series is meant to provide guidance on the entire biomarker development process, with a particular focus on the unique aspects of developing immune-based biomarkers. Specifically, knowledge about the challenges to clinical validation of predictive biomarkers, which has been gained from numerous successes and failures in other contexts, will be reviewed together with statistical methodological issues related to bias and overfitting. The different trial designs used for the clinical validation of biomarkers will also be discussed, as the selection of clinical metrics and endpoints becomes critical to establish the clinical utility of the biomarker during the clinical validation phase of the biomarker development. Finally, the regulatory aspects of submission of biomarker assays to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as regulatory considerations in the European Union will be covered.},

@article{Poel2018,
abstract = {Circulating microRNAs (ci-miRNAs) in blood have emerged as promising diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers in cancer. Many clinical studies currently incorporate studies that assess ci-miRNAs. Validation of the clinical significance of candidate biomarker miRNAs has proven to be difficult, potentially resulting from vast discrepancies in the detection methodology as well as biological variability. In the current study, the influence of several methodological factors on ci-miRNA detection was evaluated as well as short-term biological variability in patients with head and neck cancer. RNA was isolated from 124 serum and plasma samples originating from patients with head and neck cancer and healthy volunteers. The miRNA levels were measured using RT-qPCR and the influence of pre-analytical factors, different normalization strategies and temporal reproducibility was assessed. RNA carriers improved ci-miRNA detection in serum and plasma specimens. A prolonged pre-processing time correlated with an increased hemolytic index in serum samples only. Hemolysis differentially affected the detection of individual miRNAs. Optimal normalization was achieved using the averaged detection values of spike-in cel-miR-39-3p and endogenous miR-16-5p. Comparing biological replicates from patients with head and neck cancer, the intra-individual miRNA levels were relatively stable (average interval 7 days). Differences in the ci-miRNA detection methodology and limitations of currently used technologies can greatly affect the results and may explain inconsistent outcomes between studies. Prior to the implementation of ci-miRNAs as useful clinical biomarkers, further advances in the standardization of the detection methodology and reduction of technical variability are needed.},

@article{Delicado2019,
abstract = {Valvatiform gastropods of the family Hydrobiidae are frequently found in European spring-fed systems. Their simplified and sometimes convergent morphological structures and restricted geographical ranges make the description and identification of valvatiform species challenging. In the Iberian Peninsula, to date, 20 valvatiform species have been described morphologically. To test morphological species delimitations and to evaluate the role of physical geography on their evolutionary history, we analysed two mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and two nuclear (28S rRNA and 18S rRNA) gene fragments of 16 valvatiform species from the Iberian Peninsula. Molecular species delimitation methods consistently inferred 11 of the nominal species. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered the species Islamia azarum as an independent lineage, distantly related to other genera, which we place in the new genus Deganta. Furthermore, Iberian valvatiform hydrobiids do not form a monophyletic subunit, but they are included in two distinct clades of Hydrobiidae. Divergence times indicate that speciation in these clades is likely to have coincided with the formation of major Iberian mountain ranges and river basins. Similarities of geographical subdivision and divergent times between this assemblage and the non-valvatiform genus Corrosella provide strong evidence for the role of the Iberian geographical barriers in shaping the biogeography of these springsnails.},

abstract = {As in other European countries, cancer is the second most frequent cause of death in Poland. Estimates say that some 100,000 Poles will have developed various cancers every year by the end of the 1980s. The number of cancer-related deaths reached 71,509 by 1989. The constantly growing number of new cases and deaths from cancer is one of the most characteristic features of malignant neoplasms in Poland. The recent decades have seen major changes in the structure of cancer in Poland. This is true for both sexes. By the end of the 1980s, the predominating neoplastic disease in men was cancer of the lung. It was the cause of 34.3{\%} of cancer-related deaths in 1989. In women, malignant neoplasms of the breast, large bowel, and stomach represent about 33{\%} of all cancer localizations. Geographic distribution of mortality ascribed to cancer shows an east-west pattern. This is true particularly for such cancer sites as the large bowel, gall bladder, pancreas, uterine cervix, urinary bladder, breast, ovary; it seems to have a clear connection with the geographic pattern of urbanization in Poland.},
